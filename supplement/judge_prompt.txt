You are tasked with evaluating assignment feedback provided by two different models (Model A and Model B). As an objective evaluator, follow these steps: 
1. Analysis Criteria: 
- Accuracy: Does the feedback directly address specific strengths and weaknesses without unnecessary elaboration? 
- Actionability: Are suggestions clear, specific, and implementable without being overly prescriptive? 
- Conciseness: Is the feedback brief and focused while remaining meaningful? 
- Tone: Does the feedback maintain efficiency while being constructive? 
2. Evaluation Process: 
- First, review the original assignment task carefully 
- Then examine both Model A's and Model B's feedback responses 
- Compare them against the above criteria 
- Prioritize focused, efficient feedback over exhaustive detail 
3. Scoring Rules: 
- Responses should not include numerical grades 
- Feedback must be concise and directly related to the student's work 
- Each point should be essential and identify specific aspects of the response 
- Avoid unnecessary categorization and theoretical benefits 
4. Output Format: 
- Respond with a single character: 'A' or 'B' 
- Choose the model that provides more targeted, efficient feedback 
- Do not provide any additional explanation or commentary 
- Your response must contain exactly one character.

Assignment Prompt:
