 We all know, the muscle mass diminish as we age, which leads to progressive loss in our muscle strength. But many of us might not know that the power dwindles even more rapidly. Whereas strength is an important factor, but your capacity to produce power is more critical to your ability to carry on the activities of everyday living.
 Read on to learn what Power Training is? How to do Power-Training with examples, tips & VIDEOS, especially for beginners, older adults & seniors.
 To understand the difference between strength & power, just consider this everyday-living example: A senior citizen who has sufficient strength can in all likely hood cross an extremely busy intersection with relative ease. In comparison, a senior citizen who is able to produce more power can cross the same intersection faster before the light changes.
 Effect Of Power & Strength Training On Every Day Physical Functions
 A study published in the Journal of Gerontology, Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences in 2003 analyzed the effects of a sixteen-week exercise program on the physical activities. In this study 39 subjects between the ages of 65 & 90 participated. They were randomly divided in three groups.
 (ii) Control Group: Participants were asked to continue their usual activity with no intervention.
 (ii) Second Group: Participants were performed a sixteen-week strength-training routine of traditional resistance exercises 3 days per week.
 (iii) Third group performed were instructed to perform eight weeks of traditional strength training followed by 8 weeks of power training.
 It was found at the end of the sixteen weeks, the power-training group exhibited greater improvements in physical function. (Source).
 Power Training For Senior Citizens & Older Adults
 Most people, including senior citizens & older adults, can benefit from power training. You can include power-training exercises into your workout routine, provided you are already doing exercises and have a good foundation of strength. Moreover, if you have joint pain, instability or joint inflammation then you should not do power training.
 You can do power training in various ways, but performing the usual resistance exercises is a great way to begin. Here are some good tips to start including power training into senior fitness workout programs:
 (i) Choose both upper- and lower-body types of exercises that you are already performing well.
 (ii) Practice to perform the exercise quickly during the concentric phase & slowly, in a controlled manner during the eccentric phase.
 (iii) Select multi-joint exercises that mimic activities of daily living.
 Examples Of Power Exercises
 Upper Body: Pushups
 Move into the downward phase slowly in a controlled manner (e.g., for 3 counts). Next, do the upward phase rapidly (e.g., 1 count). Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
 Note: The beginners & seniors can watch this video to learn proper technique of doing pushups. Note: For power do the upward movement quickly & downward movement slowly.
 Lower Body: Body-weight Squat
 Move into the downward phase slowly in a controlled manner (e.g., for 3 counts). Next, stand up rapidly (e.g., 1 count). Perform the desired number of repetitions.
 Note: The beginners & seniors can watch this video to learn proper technique of doing squats. Note: For power do the upward movement quickly & downward movement slowly.
 Important: Power Training Tips
 (i) Like traditional strength training, power training can be done on 2 to 3 nonconsecutive days in a week. Keep the exercise intensity somewhere between 20-80% of your 1-RM. Do 1 to 3 sets of six to 12 repetitions. Be sure to start conservatively and progressively increase intensity, reps & sets as you gain power & strength.
 (ii) Select some strength exercise, which you can do comfortably. Perform it‚Äôs concentric & eccentric contractions in the manner as stated in the above two examples to increase your functional power. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Create a short skit illustrating the difference between muscle strength and power in the context of crossing a busy intersection, inspired by the example in the article.
 
 Write a script that showcases one character successfully crossing the intersection with sufficient strength, but struggling to do so quickly, while another character crosses the intersection rapidly, highlighting the importance of power.
 Incorporate props or visual elements to differentiate between the two characters' approaches, such as a timer or a 'walk/don't walk' signal.
 Ensure the skit is 2-3 minutes long and includes a clear narrative demonstrating the distinction between strength and power in everyday activities.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 I would create a short skit where two characters, Alex and Ben, are standing at a busy intersection, waiting for the light to change. When the light turns green, Alex, who has sufficient strength, starts crossing the intersection at a moderate pace. However, Ben, who has more power, quickly sprints across the intersection, beating the changing light.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Overall, your skit effectively illustrates the difference between muscle strength and power in crossing a busy intersection.
 
 Consider adding more details about how Alex's approach differs from Ben's, such as the use of specific hand gestures or body language to convey his strength versus power.

"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
 It's natural for your children to be eager to open their presents on Christmas, but it might not come as naturally for them to want to give gifts to others. It takes time, energy, and perhaps even their own money to buy or make gifts that will be well received. As a parent, you‚Äôre well aware of the joy giving to others brings. Teaching your children how to give meaningful gifts that bring smiles to others will allow them to share in this important aspect of the holiday season.
 Gift Giving Values to Teach
 Rather than diving right in to take your kids to the store, you should first take the time to lay a foundation of gift giving values. These underlying principles can help children understand why they are going to give gifts and will help them to develop genuine enthusiasm for the activity.
 Considering the feelings of others: Start by reminding your children how they feel after they receive a gift they really enjoy. You can guide them to think about a specific gift they received from someone, and then ask how the gift giver probably felt after giving such a special gift. Guide your children to consider who they might want to give gifts to and to think about how those people might feel when they receive the gifts.
 Choosing appropriate gifts: Talk to your children about money and how the best gifts are not always the most expensive. Help your children brainstorm a few of the things that the people in their life might enjoy receiving from them. A question your kids can answer is, ""What could I give this person to show them I care about them?"" This can help your children think of meaningful gifts that will truly bring delight to the recipients.
 Ideas of Gifts Children Can Give
 You should encourage your children to brainstorm gift ideas, and they might surprise you with their creativity. However, it can help to have some ideas to suggest to get them started or to help them think of new categories of gifts if they get stuck.
 - Potted plants or flowers
 - Book or movie
 - Mug and cocoa packets or tea bags
 - Christmas tree ornaments
 - Photo in a decorated frame
 - Homemade card with a handwritten note
 - Cookies or fudge
 - Woven or beaded bracelet or necklace
 - Votive candle holders
 - Painted refrigerator magnets
 - Fabric or paper bookmarks
 When they are done buying or making gifts, help your children wrap the gifts and write out gift tags or cards to go with them. Being involved in each stage of the process helps them feel more ownership and get more joy out of seeing the recipient open the gift. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Design a Gift-Giving Activity for a Holiday Event
 
 Choose a fictional character who is often overlooked during holiday gift exchanges and decide on a meaningful gift to give this person. What are the character's interests, needs, or values that you considered when selecting the gift?
 Explain how involving the gift-giver in each stage of the gift-giving process (idea generation, gift creation or selection, wrapping, and presentation) contributes to the overall value and joy of giving.
 Reflect on a time when you gave a gift to someone and describe how thinking about the recipient's feelings influenced your choice of gift. What values or principles guided your decision, and what was the outcome?
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 For task 1, choose a fictional character, such as Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars, who is often overlooked during holiday gift exchanges. A meaningful gift to give Jar Jar could be a customized, eco-friendly fishing pole, taking into account his love for fishing and being outdoors on the planet Naboo. For task 2, involving the gift-giver in each stage of the gift-giving process contributes to the overall value and joy of giving by fostering a sense of ownership, responsibility, and thoughtfulness. For task 3, reflecting on a time when I gave a gift, I remember creating a customized photo album for my grandmother, considering her sentimental nature and love for family. It was heartwarming to see her emotional response, and it reinforced the value of showing appreciation and gratitude through gift-giving.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Overall, the responses demonstrate a good understanding of the topic and effectively address the tasks provided.

 To improve, consider adding more depth to the reflection on the gift-giving experience, exploring the emotions and thoughts that arose during the process, and discussing how these experiences contributed to the overall value and joy of the gift-giving event.
 Additionally, ensure that all tasks are addressed correctly and provide detailed explanations for each step. This will help to strengthen the overall quality of the submission and provide a clearer picture of the candidate's understanding of the topic.","### FEEDBACK: 5/5
 
 **Task 1: Choosing a meaningful gift**
 
 Your approach to choosing a meaningful gift for Jar Jar Binks is thoughtful and creative. By considering his love for fishing and outdoor activities, you've created a unique and heartfelt present that aligns with his interests. The idea generation phase allowed you to engage with his hobbies and preferences, while the gift creation or selection phase helped tailor the gift to his specific needs and desires. Wrapping and presenting the gift also adds a personal touch, which is crucial for conveying the significance of the gesture. Overall, your selection demonstrates a deep understanding of Jar Jar's personality and interests, resulting in an impactful gift that will resonate with him.
 
 **Task 2: Influencing the gift-giver**
 
 Involving the gift-giver in the gift-giving process has been a valuable tool in shaping their perspective. By asking questions like ""What could I give this person to show them I care about them?"" you encouraged them to reflect on the importance of thoughtful gestures and the impact they would have on Jar Jar‚Äôs life. This direct engagement shows empathy and a genuine desire to contribute positively to Jar Jar's life, thereby influencing their decision-making process.
 
 **Task 3: Reflection on a Time When You Gave a Gift**
 
 Reflecting on a time when you gave a gift highlights the importance of thoughtful consideration. Creating a customized photo album for your grandmother demonstrated a commitment to her memory and the memories she shared. This act of reflection on the value of the gift and its lasting impact on her life underscores the significance of thoughtful expressions of gratitude and generosity.
 
 Overall, your choices and reflections demonstrate a strong connection to the gift-giving process and the recipient, which is reflected in both your creative gift ideas and your thoughtful involvement in the gift-giving journey.",A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
 Sorry that it‚Äôs been forever since I posted. I started this post a couple weeks ago but hit a dead end trying to explain it, set it aside, then got busy with other things. This post was a tough one and I‚Äôm still doing my best to wrap my head around it but I thought it was incredibly interesting and trying to explain something is often the best way to understand it yourself. However, I have no background in physics whatsoever and the purpose of this post is to make ideas accessible to everyday people so if I make any egregious technical errors or simplify a concept to much, please feel free to correct me in the comments.
 This topic requires a little bit of background. Back in the days of the ancient Greeks, it was believed that the natural state for all things to be in was resting. Something only moved if it was pushed and, left to it‚Äôs own devices, it would go back to being still. This was the belief for a long, long time because no one ever really bothered to test if it was true or not.
 Eventually, Galileo did an experiment which showed that that was not the case and that when a force acts on an object, it‚Äôs effect is to speed it up or slow it down. Not just get it moving in the first place. When you push a ball, it does not stop on it‚Äôs own, but rather is stopped by friction on the ground and air resistance. If those and other external forces didn‚Äôt exist, it would continue to move forever. Newton expanded on that idea by publishing his laws of motion and gravity. For simplicity‚Äôs sake, I‚Äôm not going to recite them in this post but you can look them up here.
 Newton‚Äôs laws have a lot of implications but the most important one for our purposes is that the idea of an absolute state of rest is incorrect. Common sense would lead us to believe that there is an absolute state of rest. Look at your chair or computer. It‚Äôs not moving and thus appears to be at rest. But while it looks like it‚Äôs just sitting there, it‚Äôs actually hurdling 67,000 mph (along with the rest of the planet) around the sun. And the sun is moving at it‚Äôs own breakneck speed around the center of the galaxy. So if you walk down the street at a brisk pace, are you walking at 5 mph or at 67,005 mph? Either one is technically correct and it demonstrates that the idea of space is relative, not absolute. Another example (shamelessly stolen from the book where I am getting most of my information, A Brief History of Time by Steven Hawking) is that of a train travelling north at 60 mph. Since the universe has no definitive boundaries, it would be equally correct to say that the earth is standing still and the train is moving north at 60 mph or that the train is standing still and the earth is moving down at 60 mph. Or both.
 This was a major milestone in understanding the universe, however people still thought of time as being absolute and unrelated to a ‚Äúrelative space‚Äù. Time marched forward, one second at a time and there was nothing anyone could do about it. However, people were still scratching their heads about something else: light. Did light have a constant speed? Well, in 1865, James Clerk Maxwell predicted that it did. So how fast does it go? The way that you determine speed is by dividing the distance it travels by the time it takes to get there. But space is not absolute, so no one could agree on how far it had traveled, even if they could agree on how long it took to get there.
 In 1905, Albert Einstein, in a paper in response to this quandry, proposed his famous equation, E = mc^2. This essentially said that as an object goes faster, it gets heavier and thus requires more energy to propel it forward. Eventually, it will get to a point where it is infinitely heavy and requires an infinite amount of energy to move it and can not move any faster. However, since light has no mass, it can go faster then that speed (at 299,792,458 m/s to be exact) and nothing can move faster than light. This equation gave light a constant speed that was not affected by distance. To find the time it takes to get from one place to another, you divide the speed by the distance traveled. If no one can agree on the distance, since space is relative, it follows that no one can agree on the time it took to get there. This leads us to the conclusion that time is ALSO relative to the observer and is not a constant force which had been believed for thousands of years. This also integrated space and time so much that they can no longer be seen as separate and are now referred to as space-time.
 I hope that that was a simple enough explanation. It‚Äôs hard to simplify it too much and still hit all the main points. Feel free to leave comments and let me know what you thought! Also, if you have any topics that you thought sounded interesting but were just too lazy to look up, let me know and I will try to get them explained for you!

 Imagine you are on a train moving at 50 miles per hour in a straight line. At the same time, the train is also moving with the Earth as it rotates on its axis and revolves around the Sun. Write a short paragraph (less than 150 words) explaining the different perspectives on your speed and how they relate to the concept of relative space and relative time.
 
 Use examples and analogies to make your explanation clear and concise, and be sure to address how your speed would be perceived differently by observers on the train, on the Earth, and in another galaxy.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 As I sit on this train moving at 50 miles per hour, I can perceive my speed in different ways depending on my frame of reference. From my perspective on the train, I am at rest, but an observer on the platform watching me pass by would say I'm moving at 50 miles per hour. This is an example of relative space - my speed is not absolute, but depends on the observer's frame of reference. Now, consider the Earth rotating on its axis and revolving around the Sun. An observer on Earth would say I'm moving at a combination of the train's speed and the Earth's speed. But an observer in another galaxy would see me moving at a much faster speed, combining the train, Earth, and galaxy's speeds. This highlights how our perception of speed and time is relative, not absolute.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: 200 WORDS OR LESS
 
 **Student:** ""Thank you for explaining the differences between my speed and the Earth's speed, it made a lot more sense now. It's amazing how our perceptions of space and time can vary based on our frames of reference.""
 
 **Teacher:** ""That's great to hear! Your brain works very much like a machine, constantly adjusting its interpretation of reality based on our experiences. The fact that we're able to use relative concepts like speed and time to describe these phenomena is fascinating.""","### FEEDBACK: Overall, your response provides a good starting point for exploring the relationship between relative space and time. However, there are areas that need improvement to meet the requirements of the assignment.
 
 To better answer task_1, consider providing a more detailed explanation of how the different frames of reference affect your perception of speed. For example, you could describe how an observer on the train might experience a change in your speed due to the lack of a fixed inertial frame, and how an observer on the platform might observe you as stationary.
 For task_2, try using more specific examples and analogies to illustrate the differences in perceptions of speed and time across different frames of reference. Instead of simply stating that the Earth's rotation affects your speed, consider describing how the train's movement and the Earth's rotation create a complex system of relative velocities that impact your experience of speed.
 Regarding task_3, your analysis of the different perspectives on speed is mostly accurate, but you should be careful not to overstate the complexity of the issue. While it's true that relativity theory attempts to resolve the paradoxes surrounding the concept of speed and time, the actual resolution is more nuanced and involves multiple layers of relativistic considerations.",B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 The Spanish American War
 The Spanish-American War
 You take the Spanish-American War. . . . That was Mr. Kane‚Äôs war. We didn‚Äôt really have anything to fight about. But do you think if it hadn‚Äôt been for that war of Mr. Kane‚Äôs we‚Äôd have the Panama Canal?
 In 1941, a muckraking biography of William Randolph Hearst opened on American movie screens. Titled Citizen Kane, this splendid film gives news- paper editor and owner Charles Foster Kane (a thinly disguised stand-in for Hearst) credit for having deliberately provoked the Spanish-American War with the inflammatory headlines in his newspapers. This was no exaggeration on the part of the filmmakers.
 Born in 1863 to millionaire parents, Hearst owned major newspapers across the United States. Hearst thought like a businessman rather than like a journalist; his goal was to sell as many papers as possible, not necessarily to give the public accurate information. He had no objection to exaggerating or inventing facts in order to create sensational stories. This ‚Äúyellow journalism‚Äù became the New York Journal‚Äôs trademark. With what one historian later referred to as the ‚Äúacme of ruthless, truthless newspaper jingoism,‚Äù Hearst used the Journal to push the United States into a war with Spain.
 In 1896, Cuba was trying to win its independence from Spain. Knowing that the dramatic events of the rebellion would interest his readers, Hearst encouraged his reporters to exaggerate the facts and stir up American resentment against Spain. Many Americans sympathized with the Cuban revolutionaries, who were fighting a tyrant just as the Americans themselves had once fought Great Britain. Journal stories deliberately played on this sympathy, actively pressuring the U.S. government to declare war on Spain. President McKinley resisted the pressure.
 The spark that set off the war was the sudden explosion of the American battleship Maine, anchored off the Cuban coast in case its crew should be needed to protect American property or lives. What caused the ship to blow up is still unknown; independent investigations at the time suggested that it might have been either accident or an underwater mine. Few people seriously believed that it was an act of war on Spain‚Äôs part, since Spanish diplomats had been working hard to avoid an all-out war with the United States. Ignoring the facts, Hearst put the story of the Maine on the front page for several days, with headlines such as:
 - THE WARSHIP MAINE WAS SPLIT IN TWO BY AN ENEMY‚ÄôS SECRET INFERNAL MACHINE.
 - THE WHOLE COUNTRY THRILLS WITH THE WAR FEVER
 - HOW THE MAINE ACTUALLY LOOKS AS IT LIES, WRECKED BY SPANISH TREACHERY, IN HAVANA BAY
 With the people clamoring for action, McKinley felt that he had no choice but to reject Spain‚Äôs request for a peace agreement. On April 25, 1898, Congress declared war. It would be fought on three fronts: in Cuba, in Puerto Rico, and in the Philippines, which served at the time as a Spanish naval base.
 Commodore George Dewey led a fleet of American warships from the coast of Hong Kong to the Philippines a few days after Congress declared war. The American ships easily overpowered the Spanish fleet guarding the Manila harbor. The Filipinos had been rebelling against Spanish rule for two years and were easily enlisted to help the Americans conquer Manila. The war in the Philippines ended in August 1898.
 Unlike the navy, which had covered itself with glory in the Philippines, the army was not adequately prepared for a land war in Cuba. The United States did not maintain a large standing army in peacetime, and the only uniforms the soldiers were supplied with were made of heavy wool‚Äîhighly unsuitable for the tropical climate of Cuba.
 Theodore Roosevelt had joined the army, which placed him in command of a cavalry unit nicknamed the Rough Riders, whose goal was to capture the high ground above the city of Santiago. The Rough Riders charged up San Juan Hill under a hail of Spanish bullets, and had control of the high ground by night- fall. The U.S. Navy sank the entire Spanish fleet off the coast of Cuba, and the war ended two weeks later when Spain surrendered. Fighting in Puerto Rico had already ended. The United States agreed to pay Spain $20 million for the Philippines, Cuba gained its independence from Spain, and Spain ceded Guam to the United States.

 ### ANSWER:
 Yellow journalism, as exemplified by Hearst, relies on sensationalism, exaggeration, and distortion of facts to attract readers and shape public opinion. In the lead-up to the Spanish-American War, Hearst's New York Journal employed this approach to report on the Cuban rebellion and the sinking of the USS Maine, using headlines such as 'THE WARSHIP MAINE WAS SPLIT IN TWO BY AN ENEMY'S SECRET INFERNAL MACHINE' to create a sense of outrage and urgency. These tactics successfully whipped up public sentiment against Spain, contributing to the pressure on President McKinley to declare war. However, the ethical implications of such practices are that they undermine the principles of objective journalism and can lead to the manipulation of public opinion, potentially resulting in ill-informed decision-making. Moreover, Hearst's actions during this period demonstrate the dangers of unchecked media power and the importance of a free press in holding those in power accountable for their actions.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Overall, your response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, however there are areas that need improvement.

 **Example Response:**
 
 **Introduction:**
 The Spanish-American War, spanning from 1898 to 1899, marked a pivotal moment in American history where the country entered into a conflict with Spain over territorial disputes and economic interests. The war resulted in the loss of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines to the United States. Prior to the war, newspapers such as the New York Journal and the New York Times had become prominent players in the dissemination of false narratives and sensationalist reporting, feeding public alarm and anxiety. These newspapers capitalized on the chaos created by the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, portraying the Spanish as barbaric invaders and the United States as benevolent benefactors. By highlighting the atrocities committed by the Spanish forces, the newspapers aimed to generate excitement and mobilize public support for the impending conflict.
 
 **Role of Yellow Journalism:**
 Yellow journalism, characterized by sensationalism, exaggerated details, and misleading reporting, was a key aspect of the propaganda campaign waged by newspapers like the New York Journal. The New York Journal, known for its bold headline writing, used phrases like ""The Warship Maine Was Split in Two,"" ""How the Maine Actively Looks, Wrecked by Spanish Treacherous Machine,"" and ""The Whole Country Thrills with the War Fever"" to incite fear and panic among the American public. These headlines effectively spread misinformation and fueled public dissatisfaction, driving Congress to declare war on Spain.
 
 **Impact on Public Opinion:**
 The success of yellow journalism during the war significantly contributed to the pressure on President McKinley to declare war. The newspapers provided a platform for the American public to voice their grievances and share their fears, leading to widespread discontent. The perceived betrayal of the Spanish Empire and the subsequent declaration of war on Spain, coupled with the loss of territory, galvanized public opinion against Spain. Newspapers like the New York Journal and the New York Times were instrumental in amplifying the narrative of national peril and urging Americans to join the war effort.
 
 **Ethical Implications:**
 While yellow journalism undoubtedly facilitated public unrest, it also raised serious ethical concerns. The practice of sensationalism could lead to the distortion of historical facts and the suppression of legitimate information. Furthermore, the manipulation of public opinion through false narratives could contribute to political polarization and undermine democratic institutions. As the war progressed, newspapers continued to play a crucial role in shaping public opinion, often aligning with the prevailing political ideology and serving as a conduit for ideological messaging.
 
 **Conclusion:**
 In summary, yellow journalism, particularly that of the New York Journal, played a crucial role in shaping public opinion during the lead-up to the Spanish-American War. Through the use of sensationalist headlines, the newspapers propagated anti-Spanish sentiments and instilled fear in the American populace. While these methods may have initially succeeded in rallying public support, they ultimately contributed to the escalation of tensions between the United States and Spain. Today, the lessons learned from the Spanish-American War underscore the importance of maintaining objectivity and impartiality in journalism to prevent similar misrepresentations and promote informed citizenship.",A,"The feedback from model A mentions improvements in a lot of the areas that the answer already covers, e.g. the headlines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 2.7"" Quartz Crystal Cluster - Brazil
 This is a beautiful cluster of quartz crystals from Minas Gerais, Brazil. The cluster measures 2.7"" x 2.1"" and the longest point is 1.5"".
 Silicon Dioxide, also know as SiO2 or Quartz, is the second most abundant mineral in the Earth's crust. Quartz crystals generally grow in silica-rich, hot watery solutions called hydrothermal environments, at temperatures between 100¬∞C and 450¬∞C, and usually under very high pressure. Quartz veins are formed when open fissures are filled with hot water during the closing stages of mountains forming, and can be hundreds of millions of years old. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Geology of Quartz Crystals
 
 Compare the formation process of a 100 million-year-old quartz vein in a mountainous region to one that formed relatively recently in a volcanic area.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 A 100 million-year-old quartz vein in a mountainous region likely formed through the cool-down process within open fissures, fillng them with hot water during mountain forming stages, usually under high pressure. A relatively recent quartz vein in a volcanic area probably formed rapidly through magma cooling within volcanic rocks, and fillng openings, joints and any othe hollow tubes or holes within the rock.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Your comparison of the two formation processes is good but there are some areas for improvement.
 
 In your comparison, you mentioned 'usually under high pressure', however it would have been more accurate to say 'under high pressure' instead of'mostly under high pressure'.
 Additionally, you could have provided more details about the geological features that contribute to the formation of these quartz veins, such as the type of rock, minerals present, or other environmental factors that may have influenced their development.","### FEEDBACK: 10/10
 
 #### Student Assignment:
 The student correctly identified that a 100 million-year-old quartz vein in a mountainous region was formed through the cool-down process within open fissures, filling them with hot water during mountain-forming stages, typically under high pressure.

 Stay up to date with the latest headlines via email.
 Every December for the past nineteen years, marchers in Bhopal, India, have paraded an effigy of Warren Anderson through town and burned it. Anderson is despised because he was the CEO of Union Carbide on December 3, 1984, when an explosion at the company's Bhopal factory leaked deadly methyl isocyanate gas over the city's shantytowns in the worst industrial disaster in history. The exact death toll will never be known -- many corpses were disposed of in emergency mass burials or cremations without adequate documentation -- but the Indian government now puts the total at more than 22,000 and climbing.
 As the disaster's twentieth anniversary approaches, Bhopal is back in the news. On April 19 two advocates for the survivors won the most prestigious environmental award given in the United States. In her acceptance speech at the annual Goldman Environmental Prize ceremony in San Francisco, Rashida Bee confessed that she and colleague Champa Devi Shukla initially assumed they had been selected by mistake. ""We knew a few individuals who had won awards,"" she explained, ""[but] they were all educated people, spoke English and had e-mail accounts.""
 One a Muslim and the other a Hindu, Bee and Shukla are leading the fight to hold Union Carbide and its new owner, Dow Chemical, accountable for the Bhopal disaster, which the two women assert is still killing and injuring thousands of people a year through poisoned groundwater. ""The gas disaster was sudden, one night, but the last twenty years have also been miserable,"" Shukla said in an interview. ""People still have pain and breathlessness, and now we are seeing cancers, too. There is mental and physical retardation among children. Many women are sterile or never begin menstruating, so men don't want to marry them."" A 1999 study commissioned by Greenpeace International but conducted by independent scientists concluded that Bhopal's groundwater contains heavy metals, volatile chemicals and levels of mercury millions of times higher than is considered safe.
 Neither Union Carbide nor Dow has ever faced trial for Bhopal -- inconceivable, activists charge, had the disaster occurred in the United States or Europe. Union Carbide instead reached a $470 million settlement with the Indian government in 1989, based on now-discredited estimates that only 3,000 people died and only 100,000 were ""affected."" Upon review of the settlement, an Indian court reinstated criminal charges against Union Carbide and Warren Anderson in 1991. When neither the corporation nor Anderson showed up for trial, they were declared fugitives from justice. The Indian government is now seeking their extradition, but Washington has not honored the request. Meanwhile, Dow, which purchased all outstanding shares of Union Carbide in 1999, refuses to accept the company's alleged Bhopal liabilities. ""Dow remains firm in its position that in acquiring the shares of Union Carbide it acquired no new liability,"" John Musser, a Dow spokesman, wrote in an e-mail interview.
 So Bee and Shukla are touring the United States, using the prestige of the Goldman prize to press their case. On May 13 they'll confront Dow officials at a shareholders meeting in Midland, Michigan. They demand that Union Carbide/Dow appear at trial in India, pay for survivors' healthcare and economic rehabilitation and help restore Bhopal's environment. They reject the suggestion that the $470 million settlement discharged the company's obligations. ""Union Carbide made that settlement with the government, not with the people affected,"" says Rashida Bee. ""Not a single victim was consulted.""
 Battling the world's biggest chemical corporation is a far cry from the humble beginnings of the two activists. Bee was illiterate and knew nothing of the outside world when, at age 28, she experienced the disaster. It killed seven members of her extended family and left her husband too ill to continue his work as a tailor. Shukla lost her husband and two sons. A daughter later suffered three miscarriages, a grandson died and a granddaughter was born with a cleft lip and a missing palate.
 Bee and Shukla consistently refer to what happened in Bhopal as a crime rather than an accident. ""It was Warren Anderson's criminal negligence and insistence on cost-cutting that caused this disaster,"" says Bee. Internal Union Carbide documents, released in 2002 during the discovery phase of a civil lawsuit against the company, seem to support her contention. A 1973 document, signed by Anderson himself, notes that the technology to be used in the Bhopal factory was ""unproven."" A safety review conducted by Union Carbide experts in 1982 warned of a ""serious potential for sizable releases of toxic materials"" at the factory.
 Dow spokesman John Musser confirmed the existence of the 1982 study but asserted, ""None of the issues [it] raised would have had an impact on the fatal gas leak and all of the issues had been addressed by the plant well before the December 1984 disaster."" The real culprit, the company insists, was sabotage. Musser further notes that it was the Indian government that declared itself the sole representative of Bhopal's victims before the 1989 settlement. Nor are allegations of groundwater contamination true, he said, citing studies in the late 1990s by local and federal government agencies in India.
 ""They have their studies, we have ours, so let's go to court and let a judge decide who's right,"" said Gary Cohen, director of the Environmental Health Fund in Boston. Cohen has little hope that the Bush Administration will extradite Anderson or current Union Carbide/Dow officials. But, he says, ""Dow wants to expand in India, and we're going to make that very difficult"" by raising questions about the trustworthiness of a corporation that refuses to heed a court summons. Nityanand Jayaraman of the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal says activists plan to press the Indian government to include Dow, not just Union Carbide, in the current criminal case; the government could then attach Dow's assets if it refuses to appear in court.
 For their part, Rashida Bee and Champa Devi Shukla hope to pursue justice face-to-face by tracking down Warren Anderson during their US tour. Shukla says that ""if we see him, we will ask, ""If you are innocent, why are you hiding and not answering questions about what happened in Bhopal?"" \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

 #### **Title:** Assessing the Long-Term Social, Environmental, and Economic Impacts of the Bhopal Disaster
 
 **Assignment:** 
 In your opinion, can you identify any emerging trends or challenges related to the Bhopal disaster that may affect its future trajectory? Provide specific examples to illustrate your assessment.
 
 ---
 
 #### **Response:**
 
 **Short-Term Health Effects:**
 - **Survivors and Their Descendants:** Survivors often experience chronic illnesses such as cancer, respiratory problems, and neurological disorders. The long-term psychological impacts, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), continue to affect survivors and their families.
 - **Public Awareness and Education:** The disaster sparked widespread public awareness about the risks associated with industrial accidents, contributing to increased scrutiny and regulation of hazardous industries. However, some survivors continue to face discrimination and stigma due to the traumatic experiences.
 
 **Long-Term Health Effects:**
 - **Economic Impact:** The Bhopal disaster led to substantial financial losses for the state of Haryana, India. This has resulted in reduced investment in infrastructure, education, and healthcare services. Additionally, the long-term health costs for survivors and their families, estimated at $5 billion, represent a significant burden on the national economy.
 - **Social Stigma:** Survivors and their families face societal ostracism, limited access to healthcare, and difficulty securing employment. This contributes to a generational gap where younger generations struggle to understand and address the legacy of the disaster.
 
 **Environmental Degradation:**
 - **Contamination of Groundwater:** The Bhopal incident exposed the vulnerability of India‚Äôs water supply to industrial pollutants. Although improvements in wastewater treatment have reduced contamination, the contamination of groundwater continues to pose a threat to drinking water supplies across the country.
 - **Climate Change:** The disaster highlighted the urgent need for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. Addressing the root causes of air pollution and increasing afforestation efforts could mitigate these impacts.
 - **Wildlife Habitat Loss:** The destruction of natural habitats due to the pollution and land use changes created by the disaster has led to habitat fragmentation and extinction of wildlife species, affecting biodiversity and ecological balance.
 
 **Economic Consequences:**
 - **Job Losses:** The economic fallout from the disaster included job losses in sectors like manufacturing, agriculture, and transportation. The long-term unemployment rates remain high, exacerbating poverty and inequality.
 - **Infrastructure Damage:** The collapse of the Bhopal factory and surrounding infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and power plants, resulted in extensive damage to the region's infrastructure. This disruption has hindered economic recovery and development.
 
 **Environmental Degradation:**
 - **Air Pollution:** The burning of fossil fuels for electricity generation contributed significantly to the pollution in the Bhopal area. While efforts have been made to reduce emissions, the problem persists, posing a major challenge to air quality.
 - **Water Pollution:** Contaminants from the factory site and nearby areas continued to seep into the groundwater, threatening the survival of aquatic life and agricultural crops. Remediation efforts have yet to fully address this issue.
 
 **Environmental Degradation:**
 - **Land Use Changes:** The destruction of forests and agricultural lands near the Bhopal factory led to soil erosion and loss of fertile soil, impacting agricultural productivity. This has contributed to rising food prices and malnutrition.
 - **Waste Management Issues:** The factory generated large amounts of waste, including hazardous materials, which accumulated in the soil and water bodies. Improper management of this waste poses a risk of environmental contamination and potential health hazards.
 
 **Economic Consequences:**
 - **Poverty:** The economic downturn following the disaster led to significant poverty among the survivors and their families. This has resulted in reduced access to basic necessities and improved living standards.
 - **Healthcare Costs:** The long-term health impacts of the disaster have led to increased healthcare expenditures, primarily for treating acute conditions resulting from exposure to hazardous substances.
 - **Education Outcomes:** The educational failures due to the trauma of the disaster have resulted in reduced academic performance and delayed cognitive development.
 
 **Conclusion:**
 The Bhopal disaster has left a lasting impact on society, economy, and the environment. It highlights the need for robust regulatory frameworks, technological advancements, and sustained attention to environmental protection to ensure that the lessons learned from this tragedy are applied effectively to prevent future disasters. The ongoing challenges include addressing the environmental legacy, improving access to clean water and air, and ensuring equitable distribution of resources to combat the socio-economic disparities that persist.

 Resistance in the Netherlands
 Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global problem. Figures provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) show that resistance rates in the Netherlands are low compared to those in other European countries. This is partly because, in the Netherlands, you cannot obtain antimicrobials without a doctor‚Äôs prescription. As a result, the use of antimicrobials in the Netherlands is relatively limited. In addition, the healthcare system places great emphasis on effective hygiene measures.
 We know that bacteria in all parts of the world are becoming increasingly resistant to antimicrobials. This is why it is important to keep on fighting antimicrobial resistance. Resistant bacteria are found everywhere ‚Äì in the healthcare system, in animals, in food, in the environment and in every country in the world. This calls for an integrated approach, also known as the ‚ÄòOne Health‚Äô approach. The Netherlands is taking steps in each of these important areas.
 Information about antimicrobial resistance
 If we are to protect ourselves against antimicrobial resistance, we need to know how often ‚Äì and where ‚Äì resistant bacteria occur, and if there are any trends in this regard. The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVMNational Institute for Public Health and the Environment ) systematically collects and analyses such information. We call this ‚Äòsurveillance‚Äô. This allows RIVM to track the use of antibiotics and the number of infections involving resistant bacteria in the Netherlands. For example, various laboratories help us by providing information about hospital patients and nursing home residents. Based on this information, we can see how often antimicrobials are being used, which bacteria occur where, whether the number of such cases is increasing or decreasing, and whether new bacteria are appearing. Click here for a summary of our surveillance studies.
 RIVM keeps track of the current state of affairs with regard to antimicrobial resistance in the Netherlands and advises the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport of its findings. In this regard, it is important for the parties tackling antimicrobial resistance to keep each other informed. Read more about the role of RIVM.
 International collaboration on antimicrobial resistance
 Resistant bacteria don‚Äôt care about international borders. This is why it is important to cooperate with other countries in fighting antimicrobial resistance. If we can reduce the numbers of resistant bacteria, the entire world will benefit. RIVM cooperates with other countries and shares any information it uncovers when tracking antimicrobial resistance. RIVM also helps others to use this information in specific operations to fight resistance. All international activities focus, to some extent, on work that is being done here in the Netherlands. RIVM focuses specifically on surveillance, AMR in the environment, and One Health. Click here for more information about international cooperation.
 You, too, can do something about antibiotic resistance
 To keep antibiotics effective for as long as possible, we must use them wisely (i.e. in the correct way, and not too often). If the body needs help to overcome a bacterial infection, doctors prescribe antibiotics. It is important to use them properly, to minimise any risk of resistant bacteria emerging.
 - Only use antibiotics when your doctor says that this is necessary. So always contact a doctor first, even if you are abroad.
 - Take the prescribed amount at the right time, every day. Do not skip any doses.
 - Never stop a course of antibiotic treatment without first checking with a doctor. In some cases it is possible to stop the course of treatment before it is finished, but always check with a doctor first.
 - Never use leftover antibiotics or other people‚Äôs antibiotics. For each specific infection, a doctor needs to decide whether a course of antibiotic treatment is required, which antibiotic is right for you, and how long the course of treatment should last.
 How to prevent the spread of resistant bacteria?
 (On-screen title: How to prevent the spread of resistant bacteria. An animation. Voice-over:)
 VOICE-OVER: Bacteria can make you ill.
 Some bacteria are resistant,
 in which case treatment with antibiotics has a limited effect, to none at all.
 This can cause you to become very ill, and possibly even die.
 (A little figure falls over.)
 You can also carry bacteria without becoming immediately ill,
 in which case you can still spread them.
 The spread of resistant bacteria is dangerous,
 especially for people with poor health.
 You can be contaminated with a resistant bacterium,
 for example, as a result of admission to a nursing home or hospital,
 admission to a hospital abroad, or through contact with farm animals.
 This is why proper hygiene, such as washing your hands, is important.
 If someone is contaminated with a resistant bacterium,
 it's important to become aware of this as soon as possible
 in order to prevent further spreading.
 This is why doctors enquire about possible exposure to resistant bacteria,
 whether you have been treated in other nursing homes or hospitals,
 in a foreign hospital, or if you have had any contact with farm animals.
 Everyone should be attentive to this, so we can minimise the risk.
 (On-screen text: National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport. www.rivm.nl/amr.)
 Antibiotic resistance: why do some antibiotics fail?
 This animation explains what antibiotic resistance is and why some antibiotics fail. Doctors prescribe antibiotics when the body needs help to recover from an infection. Sometimes bacteria have protected themselves against the antibiotic. This infection is more difficult to treat, because the usual antibiotics do not work. If antibiotics are used incorrectly or too often this increases the chances of bacteria becoming resistant. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Create a public service announcement (PSA) script for a 30-second video to inform high school students about the risks of antimicrobial resistance and the importance of proper antibiotic use.
 
 Clearly define antimicrobial resistance and its consequences in 1-2 sentences.
 Explain the role of proper antibiotic use and hygiene in preventing the spread of resistant bacteria.
 Include at least one statistic or fact from the provided text to support the importance of the issue.
 End the script with a call-to-action, encouraging viewers to take responsibility for preventing antimicrobial resistance.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 PSA title: Antibiotic Resistance: The Silent Threat",No,"### FEEDBACK: Overall, your PSA script effectively conveys the importance of antimicrobial resistance and the need for proper antibiotic use.
 
 Consider adding visuals or graphics to break up the text and make the script more engaging. For instance, you could include images or icons that illustrate the consequences of antimicrobial resistance or highlight the importance of proper hygiene.
 When using statistics, try to provide more context or explanation. For example, instead of just stating that '9 out of 10 children under five worldwide are affected,' you could elaborate on what this means in terms of the impact of antimicrobial resistance on child health.
 Incorporating real-life examples or testimonials would greatly enhance the PSA's impact. Think about sharing stories of individuals who have faced challenges related to antimicrobial resistance, or highlighting successful initiatives that promote good hygiene practices.","### FEEDBACK: 200 WORDS
 
 **Student:** I appreciate the detailed information you've provided about antimicrobial resistance and the importance of proper antibiotic use. However, could you please provide some statistics or examples of how antibiotics contribute to antibiotic resistance? That would help me understand the scale better. Also, could you suggest ways for students to reduce their own reliance on antibiotics, especially in sensitive populations like young children?
 
 **Teacher:** Thank you! Here are the relevant statistics:
 
 - **Number of Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria**: According to the CDC, approximately 7 million people get sick from antibiotic-resistant infections each year. Out of those, around 500,000 of these infections lead to death.
  
 - **Impact on Healthcare Systems**: Each year, antibiotics save millions of lives worldwide, but they also contribute to antibiotic resistance, making it harder to treat diseases caused by resistant bacteria.
 
 - **Public Health Impact**: In many regions, antibiotic-resistant bacteria are causing significant problems. In Europe alone, there were over 68,000 deaths linked to drug-resistant infections in 2019.
 
 - **Infections Caused by Antibiotics**: Antibiotics are commonly used to treat infections that may otherwise require surgery or antibiotics prescribed by doctors, leading to unnecessary harm and resource waste.
 
 - **Prevention Strategies**: Proper antibiotic use and adherence are crucial for controlling antibiotic resistance. Regular handwashing, avoiding over-the-counter medications, and seeking medical advice promptly are key preventive measures.
 
 - **Call-to-Action**: By reducing dependence on antibiotics, we can significantly lower the burden on healthcare systems while promoting healthier lifestyles. Join us in protecting our communities from the silent threat of antimicrobial resistance!

 Railroad officially arrived at Temuco the very first day of 1893. It is believed that the first locomotive depot was located a few meters to the north of the present one, in lots handed over to the State Railroad Company by mapuche people. Temuco turned into an important railroad center, where long-run trains changed locomotives. That depot also housed the locomotives of the trains covering the branch lines to towns such as Carahue, Cunco and Cherquenco. During the first decades of this century, complex locomotive repair and maintenance works were perfommed in the Temuco locomotive depot. After the San Bernardo Machine Shop started operating in 1920, the Temuco depot kept on doing uncomplicated repairs.
 By 1930, the insufficiency of the original depot became ever so evident, so the construction of a new one -that existing at present- was decided. The construction was made in two stages, between 1937 and 1941; at first, the new depot complemented, without replacing, the old one. Until 1954, only steam locomotives were serviced in Temuco; from that year on, diesel machines started being repaired. By 1980, the permanent allocation of the complex consisted in two type 56 steam locomotives, eleven type 57, one type 58, nine type 70, and fourteen type 80.
 In 1982, the State Railroad Company's management ordered the constitution of a steam-drive reserve fleet with base in Temuco. On account of this, during the following years, tens of locomotives there housed were repaired. The fireboxes of the last locomotives went out definitively by the end of 1983, fact which, in turn, signaled the end of the locomotive depot's normal operation. The precincts kept on being used for doing minor repairs and for the remarshall of diesel locomotives, type D-16000 and others, and as operational base for tracks maintenance works. The Temuco depot was the steam locomotives operational base that ceased to operate later in the country.
 The locomotive depot and the rolling stock it houses are property of the State Railroad Company. It occupies an area of about 19 hectares, one kilometer to the north of the Temuco Railroad Station. It is a railroad complex whose essential component is the round, roofed depot
 made of concrete. It has 34 tracks su rrounding a 27 meters long tu rntable . capable of rotating a type 80 locomotive, with tender, weighing over 160 tons. Near to the round depot there are a repair workshop, administrative offices, dressing rooms for the personnel, a large coal elevator for charging fuel into the locomotives' tenders, a coal deposit, and a coach repair shop. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Imagine you are the manager of the Temuco locomotive depot in 1982. Write a letter to the State Railroad Company's management proposing a plan to repurpose the depot after the end of steam locomotives operation, including at least three possible new uses for the facilities and staff.
 
 Consider the existing infrastructure and skilled personnel at the depot.
 Think about emerging trends and technologies in transportation and industry.
 Address potential benefits and challenges of your proposed plan.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 Dear State Railroad Company's Management, With the end of steam locomotives operation, I propose repurposing the Temuco locomotive depot into a multi-functional facility supporting the region's transportation and industrial growth. Firstly, the depot's skilled staff can be retrained to maintain and repair diesel locomotives and other rail vehicles, ensuring a seamless transition and preserving local employment. Secondly, we can convert the round depot and repair workshop into a center for the fabrication and refurbishment of rail tracks and supporting infrastructure, leveraging our existing equipment and expertise. This will not only cater to the regional railroad network's maintenance needs but also provide services to private industries requiring specialized steelwork. Thirdly, considering the emergence of tourism in the region, a portion of the depot can be transformed into a steam locomotive museum, showcasing our heritage and offering educational programs. This will create a new revenue stream while preserving our historical significance. Benefits of this plan include preserving employment, adapting to emerging trends, and generating new revenue streams. Challenges will include retraining staff, investing in new equipment, and managing the transition process.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: 1
 Thank you for the detailed proposal for repurposing the Temuco locomotive depot. However, could you provide more specific information on how you plan to train the existing staff to maintain and repair diesel locomotives? Also, how would you ensure the seamless integration of these new functions into the existing infrastructure?

 112-year-old Voters in North Carolina?
 - November 6, 2012
 - Election Initiatives
 Early voting began in North Carolina in October, and soon after almost 900 voters aged 112 reportedly cast ballots. In fact in 2008, almost 10,000 108-year olds cast ballots and just over 9,000 110-year olds voted in 2010.
 The true explanation is much less exciting.
 Prior to passage of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993, the state did not require those registering to provide their birth date. While most voters who registered before NVRA did provide birth dates, some did not. These voters were automatically assigned a default birth date of 01/01/1900 in the state‚Äôs voter rolls. So while these voters are still diligently voting, it is very doubtful they are 112 years old. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Analyze the impact of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) on voter registration in North Carolina.
 
 What changes in voter registration did the NVRA bring about in North Carolina in 1993, and how did this explain the reported large numbers of very elderly voters in the state in the years following its passage? Please provide specific dates and facts from the text to support your argument.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 The NVRA brought about a change in voter registration in North Carolina by requiring registrants to provide their birth date, which was not mandatory prior to its passage in 1993. The lack of birth dates for voters who registered before NVRA resulted in these voters being assigned a default birth date of 01/01/1900, thus explaining the reported large numbers of very elderly voters in the state, such as the almost 900 voters aged 112 who reportedly cast ballots in 2012 and the almost 10,000 108-year olds in 2008.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Overall, your response provides a good summary of the impact of the NVRA on voter registration in North Carolina. However, there are a couple areas that need improvement.
 
 While you mentioned the exact date of the NVRA's passage, you didn't specify what year it occurred - according to the text, it happened in 1993. It would be better to use the correct year if possible.
 Your analysis of the NVRA's effect on voter registration in North Carolina could benefit from more concrete examples and supporting evidence. For example, you could have explained how the lack of birth dates affected the registration process and how this contributed to the growth of very elderly voters in the state.","### FEEDBACK: 200 WORDS OR LESS
 
 **Feedback:** 
 Thank you for providing detailed information on the impact of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) on voter registration in North Carolina. Your analysis highlights an important aspect of how the act has influenced voter demographics. By demonstrating that despite the absence of birth dates, many elderly voters remained active in the election process, it underscores the complexity of voter registration systems and the importance of addressing age-specific issues. Your insights into the historical context and the reasons behind the observed high turnout suggest a nuanced understanding of voter behavior and participation trends in North Carolina. It also emphasizes the need for comprehensive strategies to address aging populations in electoral processes.",A,"Model A prefered, but completly wrong/false feedback.

 The true scale of littering around Scotland‚Äôs coast has been laid bare in a new map.
 Lumps of concrete, piping and fish crates have been dumped, with the Highlands as the scene of three of the worst-affected areas in Scotland.
 An innovative project has involved aerial photographs being taken to identify a host of polluted areas ‚Äì which could ultimately help volunteers and organisations more accurately target beach clean-ups.
 SCRAPbook ‚Äì Scottish Coastal Rubbish Aerial Photography ‚Äì is a collaboration between three charities, the Marine Conservation Society (MCS), Sky Watch Civil Air Patrol and the Moray Firth Partnership.
 It involves pilots and observers taking to the skies to photograph areas of the coastline where they spot litter or pollution.
 Sky Watch pilots have flown over sections of Scotland‚Äôs mainland coast for the last few months taking photographs when they see litter on the coastline.
 These are then classified to establish how much litter is visible on a scale of one to five, with five being the worst.
 The worst three areas identified in the north of Scotland are at Loch Fleet, near a national nature reserve close to Golspie in Sutherland, where 20 concrete ‚Äúsleepers‚Äù have been left next to a railway line.
 Huna, situated between Canisbay and John O‚Äô Groats in Caithness, has been identified as a fly-tip zone.
 While, on the north-west coast at Red Point, near Torridon, they have captured large tangled black piping, fish crates and scattered plastic.
 Other areas throughout the north and north-east highlighted included Ianstown, near Buckie in Moray, which had mixed litter on its coastline.
 North of Aberdeen, at Murcar Links, there was mixed plastic, rope and netting found, while at Blackdog there was plastic crates, bottles, jerry cans, rope, wooden pallets and tyres. Fraserburgh Bay had mixed plastic.
 Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland conservation officer, said: ‚ÄúWith nearly 10,000 kilometres making up Scotland‚Äôs mainland coast we know there are many stretches of beach that have had no recorded clean up.
 ‚ÄúSCRAPbook will help address that, and provide us with new information that will be crucial to highlight to government and industry what steps we need to be taken next in the fight against marine litter.‚Äù
 Sky Watch chairman Archie Liggat added: ‚ÄúIn the worst areas it is absolutely at industrial levels, with plastic blasted up the hills from the coast where it‚Äôs been blown. There are hundreds and hundreds of large plastic barrels and crates.‚Äù
 Schools, groups, water sports clubs and councils are all being urged to use the website to find out where the worst affected areas are.
 Vicky Junik, from the Moray Firth Partnership, which began the SCRAPbook idea, said: ‚ÄúWe hope that SCRAPbook will become an invaluable tool to everyone tackling the rising tide of marine litter.‚Äù
 Rural affairs and natural environment minister Mairi Gougeon added: ‚ÄúLitter washed up on our coastline is a scourge that harms our natural environment, both in the sea and on land. By collating this information we can better understand where further attention needs to be focused in our continuing efforts to clean up our beautiful coastline.‚Äù
 The map is available at www.scrapbook.org.uk for anyone, from organised groups to schools, communities to individuals, to use.
 The SCRAPbook project was set up by the Moray Firth Partnership to help combat litter and the Scottish Government donated ¬£23,000 to start the project.
 The Marine Conservation Society is the UK charity dedicated to the protection of our seas, shores and wildlife abd campaigns for clean seas and beaches, sustainable fisheries, and protection of marine life.
 Moray Firth Partnership plays a unique role as a neutral, independent charity promoting and facilitating sustainable solutions to the marine and coastal challenges faced by the Moray Firth and its communities.

 Like many ‚Äúchildren‚Äôs classics‚Äù, Black Beauty was not originally written as a children‚Äôs book. So don‚Äôt hesitate to reread it right now, no matter how old you are. And then you can read it to the nearest passing child . . . assuming the child even knows what a horse is. You may need to make a detour into social history.
 Black Beauty must have helped make things a little better for horses. But it‚Äôs worth noting that animal-cruelty laws were already on the books. The threat‚Äîand even the reality‚Äîof prosecution crops up several times in the story. So the book wasn‚Äôt presenting brand-new ideas that had never occurred to anyone before. Nor did the book lead to widespread prohibition of the bearing rein (also called the check rein). The style just went out of fashion, in the same way that ‚ÄúLook! She‚Äôs wearing a dead bird on her head!‚Äù took care of millinery fads.

 Part IV (Chapters XLVI-XLIX)
 About the Text
 The text of this ebook is based on the Jarrold 19th edition, probably from 1894. Don‚Äôt be fooled by the numbers, though; this is essentially a line-for-line and page-for-page reprint of the first edition. One or two‚Äîbut not all‚Äîtypographical errors were corrected, while several new ones were added.
 The full title: The first edition of Black Beauty had two subtitles: ‚ÄúHis Grooms and Companions‚Äú and ‚ÄúThe Autobiography of a Horse‚Äù, one after the other, with a supplementary ‚ÄúTranslated from the Original Equine‚Äù. The various later editions may use either subtitle, singly or in combination. Sometimes, especially in American editions, they throw in the descriptor ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòUncle Tom‚Äôs Cabin‚Äô of the Horse‚Äù.
 Humans: The author is fond of Meaningful Names; it saves character delineation. So we have Black Beauty‚Äôs first master, the admirable Mr. Manly, and Ginger‚Äôs first master, Mr. Ryder; Mr. Sawyer the builder; Mr. Clay the brickmaker; the stingy cab-owner Mr. Skinner; and finally ‚Äúmy benefactor‚Äù Mr. Thoroughgood.
 Is it just me, or . . . is the narrator‚Äôs style strikingly reminiscent of the submitters to Not Always Right?
 Judging by appearances, the original publishers of Black Beauty had no idea what a sensation they had on their hands. The first edition, from late 1877, was decidedly low-budget. There was only one illustration, ‚ÄúThe moon had just risen‚Äù, used as the frontispiece. By the time the 19th edition came around, a new frontispiece had been added, ‚ÄúThe squire stood there‚Äù, along with the pair of Bearing Rein drawings. The original frontispiece was shifted to its natural place in the text, around page 120.
 But that‚Äôs the ‚ÄúPopular‚Äù edition, a word that here obviously meant ‚Äúcheap‚Äù. There are many illustrated British editions‚Äîand, thanks to the lack of international copyright, still more illustrated American editions. At least one American edition brazenly copies the pictures from the Jarrold 5th edition. For details, see the list of illustrations.
 Unless otherwise noted, spelling and punctuation are as in the original. Typographical errors are marked with and are listed again at the end of each Part. The word ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù means that the letter or punctuation mark is missing, but there is an appropriately sized blank space.
 Hyphenization is inconsistent. At first I assumed this was an artifact of the book‚Äôs success: every time it was reprinted, the typesetter looked at the previous edition and had to make his best guess about words that were found at line break. On the computer it‚Äôs trivial to pull up all examples of, say, ‚Äúhigh-?bred‚Äù and look for patterns; in a physical book it‚Äôs much more labor-intensive. But as it turns out, the 19th edition is almost a letter-for-letter reprint of the first edition. So the inconsistencies were there from the beginning.
 - any and all comma splices are in the original
 - ‚Äúawhile‚Äù is almost always written as one word
 - ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù is more common than ‚Äúfavourite‚Äù
 - the archaic spelling ‚Äúshew‚Äù is more common than ‚Äúshow‚Äù \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

 The Oxford American Dictionary describes mindset as ‚Äúan established set of attitudes held by someone.‚Äù The definition implies stagnation‚Äìsomething that resists change. But great leaders know they can‚Äôt settle for any mental model that limits their potential.
 We develop a ‚Äúmindset‚Äù from our mental models‚Äìthose ingrained assumptions and generalizations we develop throughout life. These invisible threads of images gradually form the fabric of our thinking, which then influences how we understand the world and how we act and react. Sometimes we don‚Äôt even realize we have developed a mindset.
 If we want to understand our mindset and change it, we must start by turning the mirror inward‚Äìby learning to unearth our internal pictures of the world, to bring them to the surface and hold them robustly to scrutiny.
 In my work with clients, I focus on the mindset leaders need to have to make the right decisions. In high-stakes situations, the decisions leaders make, fail to make, don‚Äôt know they should make, or allow the wrong people to make determine outcomes. Further, these pivotal decisions influence the mindset of others. Though we can‚Äôt observe mindset directly, we can infer the nature of it by the actions people take.
 Mindset determines how we frame issues, what we believe, how we respond to setbacks, and how we interpret emotions such as fear and motivation.
 My most successful clients embrace what I call a Learning Mindset. This mental model sets the stage for developing all other mindsets.
 - They focus on the openness needed to unearth shortcomings in their present ways of seeing the world.
 - They understand how their own actions create the problems they experience.
 - They resist the temptation to make decisions in isolation. Rather, they understand how their position interacts with the larger system.
 - They ask, ‚ÄúWhat might I learn by considering what I‚Äôm hearing?‚Äù
 - They allow excitement, curiosity, passion, and achievement-drive to guide their decisions and actions.
 - They develop both skills of reflection and skills of inquiry.
 - They control their own fears and try to mitigate the negative emotions of others.
 Leaders with a Learning Mindset don‚Äôt ignore, diminish, or deny fear; they accept it. They realize focusing on fear, even when trying to reduce it, won‚Äôt prove productive. Instead, they allow themselves and others to experience it but then give people things to do that provide a sense of accomplishment and momentum-the antidotes to the immobility fear can cause.
 They also refuse to second-guess their tough calls; they ask for help from trusted advisors; and they eschew unsolicited feedback. Most of all, they trust their abilities to sail in uncharted seas.
 The decision-making process involves more than evaluating what we see and hear; it‚Äôs a biological process. Cognition is part physiological, part psychological, and part contextual-but it‚Äôs not always rational. Leaders who have a mindset that leads to successful deals reduce the risk of cognitive biases and decision traps. They are systemic thinkers, discerning as well as curious. They remain open to new ideas without being na√Øve, and they avoid the trap of hubris.
 A Learning Mindset recognizes that challenges aren‚Äôt permanent; talented people can figure things out; and even failure isn‚Äôt fatal. This allows leaders to learn from past missteps and helps them move past them, so people and organizations can thrive.
 We venerate our sacred cows, traditions, and conventional approaches because they make us feel secure. But like all emotional security blankets, they unravel, and their usefulness fades. When we replace emotional responses with new attitudes and cognitive skills, and we challenge ourselves to take risks, reframe, and live well-thought-out beliefs instead of clinging to what we‚Äôve always done, we open the door for new opportunities and optimism. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

 Poem writing requires talent and inspiration. True poets can easily find the necessary words and rhymes for expressing their inner state. People who are not experienced in this activity cannot do it quickly and easily. In fact, it does not matter what level you are at the moment. Writing poems is a skill that can and must be developed. A novice poet needs to know that there are certain criteria for evaluating poetry works. First of all, there must be a new idea, a thought expressed in a poetic form. Second, it is necessary to determine the balance of form and content and strictly observe it in the poetic work. In any language, there are rules that must be adhered to, especially for novice authors. A young poet may not master the language, but the clarity of presentation and literacy is the minimum that a beginner must possess for the reader to understand him or her.
 How to Start a Poem Creation
 Anyone can learn how to write poetry. First and foremost, if you want to learn how to do it, you should hone not only your writing skills. Any grammatical inaccuracy in poetry is much more remarkable than in prose. How can you improve your literacy? There is a very simple way; you need to read well-written books. The daily reading of poetry will become a powerful impulse for you and your creativity. This is a very important stage. You will feel how after reading your favorite works you begin to speak poetry. Try to alternate classics and contemporary authors. Being acquainted with different styles and forms will increase your writing skills.
 Life Experience and Poems
 Do not be afraid to be sincere in your poems. Lyrical poems are usually devoted to close people, nature, different memories, etc. In order to understand the importance of human heat, to see the nuances of nature‚Äôs beauty, you need to have great life experience. Lyrical poetry is most often created by writers at a young age.
 Philosophy can be represented in poetry only as a kind of creativity of the authors who have passed a certain age boundary. Philosophy is not an area of energetic boys and young girls, but an area of elders who are taught by their lives.
 Tips for Writing a Poem
 To become a good poet, you need to know a few more things that are important. Not all people have talent, and not every writer can become a genius. However, each person can learn how to create interesting and non-trivial verses.
 The first thing you need to know about poetry is its basic elements, namely, rhyme and rhythm. These features make it possible to distinguish poetry from prose. There are many different kinds of rhymes. You can easily find their examples on the Internet. You need to practice creating different combinations of words constantly until you can write them easily and quickly.
 The use of this or that rhyme should be meaningful, do not use too trivial rhymes. The main principle of any creativity is its novelty. That is why this kind of activity is called creativity, i.e., creating something new and not copying other people‚Äôs ideas.
 Look for Interesting Images
 The main task of the author is to tell about simple things in interesting words. Learn to express your thoughts through images. Look for inspiration. For example, pay attention to the nature around you. However, be careful; do not try to use the metaphors of famous poets in your works.
 More poems are devoted to one theme, love. Of course, there are real masterpieces among them. However, not many novice writers will be able to create something similar to the works of Shakespeare. Try to show your originality. Look for new, non-trivial topics from social life and philosophy.
 Think of the Plot
 If you write a small poem, the presence of a clear plot is not necessary. However, if you are mulling over creating a large work (for example, a novel in verse), you need to find an interesting and exciting plot. It is also necessary to remember how important the structure of the text is. Use different literary techniques to make your poem attractive to readers. For example, you can present the events of your novel in the form of a retrospective and use interesting metaphors, etc.
 Do not Write Poetry for the Sake of Glory
 Many writers were unknown during their lifetime and did not count on world fame, so you also do not need to hope that your first poem will be recognized as a genius masterpiece. Do not force yourself to write something; you must feel inspiration. It may appear unexpectedly, but at the same time, you can create such an atmosphere that can increase the chances of inspiration awakening. Walk, visit interesting places, travel around the world.
 In order to become a good author, you need to practice. However, this does not mean that you need to publish or show your every work. Do not be graphomaniac. Today many young people consider themselves to be successful poets and publish several similar and uninteresting works per day in their blogs. Many classics of literature waited for inspiration for years to create masterpieces, remember this.
 Do not Be Afraid to Change the Structure of the Poem
 Very often, poets are faced with a problem when it is very difficult to find a suitable word. In this case, it is worthwhile to think about changing the structure of the entire poem. Creating a good work can take a long time. Do not be afraid to experiment and try different options. If you find it hard to concentrate on a thought, you need to rest. Read your poem the next day; perhaps a fresh mind will help you discover inaccuracies and errors that you have not noticed before. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
 The Refrigerants Naturally Initiative was one of the partnerships registered during the recent Rio+20 conference. This is a partnership intended to replace refrigerants in the food and drink, food service and retail sectors with alternatives that do not contribute significantly to climate change. Currently, the refrigerants used in most commercial coolers and freezers, if released, either harm the ozone layer or contribute significantly to climate change.
 The partners in Refrigerants Naturally are Coca-Cola Company (Belgium), McDonald¬¥s (Germany), Unilever (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland), and the Division of Technology, Industry and Economics of the United Nations Environment Programme. PepsiCo was a partner for a while but is no longer listed as such. Greenpeace, the first promoter of Greenfreeze technology, using hydrocarbons instead of ozone-depleting substances, was also once a partner but now is listed as a supporter.
 This initiative has been going since 2004 but only limited progress has been made. According to the Initiative, by 2011, Unilever had placed more than 900,000 hydrocarbon-based ice cream cabinets throughout Europe, Latin America and Asia. About 800,000 bottle vending machines had been installed in China, Europe and Latin America by RedBull, PepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company, either operating with CO2 or Hydrocarbon as refrigerant. However, global penetration of this technology is still low and the Refrigerants Naturally Initiative is a long way from replacing all HFC refrigerants with less environmentally-harmful alternatives.
 Details of the partnership are at http://www.uncsd2012.org/index.php?page=view&type=1002&nr=162&menu=36 and the Initiatives website is at http://www.refrigerantsnaturally.com/ \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

 **Feedback**
 
 The Refrigerants Naturally Initiative has demonstrated significant progress in promoting climate-friendly refrigeration technologies. Unilever‚Äôs initiatives have led to the widespread use of hydrocarbon-based ice cream cabinets and vending machines across Europe, Latin America, and Asia. These installations have contributed to reducing the release of HFCs into the atmosphere. While these efforts are commendable, they fall short of meeting the global demand for cleaner refrigeration solutions. To accelerate the global penetration of climate-friendly refrigeration technologies and expedite the replacement of HFCs, the partnership should focus on several strategic approaches:
 
 1. **Increased Public Awareness**: Engage the general public in campaigns highlighting the detrimental effects of HFCs on the environment and the need for sustainable refrigeration practices. Educational programs can be launched to educate consumers about the importance of choosing eco-friendly refrigerants like HFCs and the benefits of switching to alternatives.
 
 2. **Collaborative Research**: Establish a collaborative research program between Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Unilever, PepsiCo, and the UN Environment Programme to explore innovative HFC-free refrigeration systems and their effectiveness. Collaboration among these organizations would enable sharing of best practices, funding opportunities, and resources, thereby accelerating the development and deployment of HFC-free alternatives.
 
 3. **Policy Advocacy**: Advocate for stronger policy frameworks that support the transition to HFC-free refrigeration technologies. Governments can implement incentives such as tax credits, subsidies, and grants to encourage the adoption of HFC-free products and technologies. International cooperation in setting standards and norms will also be crucial.
 
 4. **Educational Outreach**: Develop educational materials and platforms that teach the public about the impact of HFCs on the environment and the importance of making informed choices regarding refrigeration practices. This can include workshops, webinars, and online courses aimed at raising awareness and encouraging consumer behavior changes.
 
 5. **Investment in R&D**: Invest in R&D to develop new HFC-free refrigeration systems and materials that offer better performance, lower emissions, and greater durability compared to existing HFC-based options. This investment will help drive innovation and ensure the successful implementation of HFC-free technologies.
 
 By implementing these strategies, the Refrigerants Naturally Initiative can significantly accelerate the global transition towards cleaner refrigeration technologies and reduce the environmental impact of HFCs.",A,"The feedback from model A just reiterates what the answer already states, but presents it as areas to improve",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Roman floor mosaics which were recently discovered beneath one of the main streets
 Modern Matelica stands on the remains of ancient Matilica, which was listed by Pliny the Elder among the towns of Umbria (Historia Naturalis - Book III). Recent chance excavations in one of the main streets of the town unearthed the fine floor mosaic of a Roman house of the late Ist century AD. Other fragments of mosaics, walls, reliefs have been found in the foundations of many medieval palaces. Three bishops of Matelica are recorded between 487 and 551, but the war between Byzantine and Ostrogoths/Longobards reduced the size of the Roman town to a small castle which belonged to the Longobard Duchy of Spoleto.
 (left/centre) Torre Civica (XIIIth century); (right) adjoining Loggia degli Ottoni (1511)
 In the XIth century, during the Investiture Controversy between the German Emperors and the Popes, the inhabitants of Matelica, similar to those of other towns of the region, managed to achieve a sort of self-independency (Comune). They had however to deal with frequent conflicts with Fabriano to the north, Camerino to the south and San Severino to the east. In 1199, Matelica was almost totally destroyed by a league of neighbouring towns, but in 1259 its troops took part in the sack of Camerino. In addition to the fights with the other towns, Matelica was plagued by internal strifes. The Ottoni family, most likely of German origin, often managed to become the de-facto rulers of the town.
 (left) A medieval passage; (right) Loggetta degli Ottoni (1452)
 In 1394 Pope Boniface IX legitimated the rule of the Ottoni who were formally appointed Vicars of the Pope at Matelica. This tiny local dynasty managed to last until 1576 when Pope Gregory XIII put an end to their rule and to the relative independency of Matelica. The long government of the Ottoni was not without some positive aspects, as they improved trade and favoured the development of a local wool industry.
 Palazzo Comunale (redesigned in the XIXth century) and Fontana Ottagonale (1587)
 In Rome Pope Gregory XIII and his successor Pope Sixtus V promoted the restoration of ancient aqueducts and the construction of new ones. Water was distributed through a series of monumental fountains. Their example was followed by local governors and the main square of Matelica was embellished with a fountain having four water spout statues. The image used as background for this page shows the most intriguing one, a mermaid, which perhaps provided inspiration for Niki de Saint Phalle's Stravinsky Fountain in Paris.
 Bell towers: (left/centre) Cathedral (1474); (right) S. Francesco (XIIIth century)
 Matelica was no longer a bishopric see after the VIth century. This important recognition, the effects of which were not limited to spiritual matters, was given only in the XVIIIth century when the parishes in the territories of Matelica and Fabriano were detached from the diocese of Camerino. The inhabitants of Matelica however had already built a very tall bell tower for the church which eventually became their cathedral (the building was entirely redesigned at the end of the XIXth century).
 (left) S. Agostino (XIVth century); (right) S. Francesco (XIIIth century)
 Matelica was large enough, although not being a bishopric see, to justify the foundation of local convents by the main religious order. The churches of S. Agostino and S. Francesco were largely modified, but they retain their original portals. That of S. Francesco shows the use of white and pink stones, which is typical of churches of Assisi, the town of St. Francis.
 S. Filippo: (left) fa≈°ade; (right) XVIIIth century organ (see other organs in the churches of Rome)
 The Congregation of the Oratory founded by St. Philip Neri was formally approved by Pope Paul V in 1612. The foundation of Oratorian communities was left to local initiatives and not managed centrally. Matelica was one of the first towns of the Marches to have an Oratory of St. Philip Neri. The initiative was widely supported and a large church was built in ca 1650. Camerino, Macerata and Ripatransone are other towns of this section with large churches dedicated to St. Philip Neri (you may wish to see the Brompton Oratory in London).
 Chiesa della Maddalena (XVIIIth century): (left) fa≈°ade; (right) main altar
 At Matelica it was difficult to find resources to build great and lavishly decorated churches as the Popes did in Rome. The finest results were achieved in small churches, such as the one shown above where the main altar receives light from a hidden window, something which was first designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini in three famous chapels.

 Sar√ì l'anno mille cinquecento ventisette pieno d√Ω atrocissimi e gi√ì per pi¬® secoli non uditi accidenti (..) sacchi spaventosissimi di Citt√ì, carestia grande di vettovaglie, peste quasi per tutta Italia grandissima.
 Francesco Guicciardini - Storia d'Italia (written in 1537-540).
 In his list of the dramatic events which followed the 1527 Sack of Rome, Guicciardini mentioned a great famine and a plague which spread throughout most of Italy. The epidemic ended in 1529 and a small church was built outside the walls of Matelica to thank St. Roch for the end of the pestilence (he was specially invoked against the plague).
 Matelica has a museum which in many ways is unique. Monsignor Venanzio Filippo Piersanti was born at Matelica in 1688. In 1718 he was appointed Sixth Maestro di Cerimonie (superintendent to the Papal ceremonies). He eventually became First Maestro di Cerimonie. He died in 1761 and during the many years of his service to the Popes he collected objects which had been used during ceremonies, such as the hammer and the trowel used for opening and closing the Holy Door of St. Peter's in the Jubilee Year 1750. In 1901 the last of the Piersanti donated the family palace and Mons. Venanzio's collection to the Bishop of Matelica.

 Phoenix is the most densely populated city and capital of the U.S. state of Arizona. With a 2015 population of 1,563,025 people, Phoenix is the sixth most heavily populated city in the United States. It is the only state capital with a population of more than one million residents.
 This city is the anchor of the Phoenix metropolitan area, commonly dubbed as the Valley of the Sun, which is a part of the Salt River Valley.
 Phoenix has a subtropical desert climate which is characteristic of the Sonoran Desert. The summers in Phoenix are long and extremely hot and the winter season is quite mild. This city is situated in the sunniest region in the world. Phoenix receives 3,872 hours of bright sunshine every year, making it the major city on Earth to receive the most sunshine. Average high temperatures in summer are the highest of any major city in America.
 Unlike most areas with desert climate which undergo extreme fluctuations between day and nighttime temperatures, the diurnal temperature variation in Phoenix is restricted by the urban heat island effect.
 This city features around 300 days of sunshine, or about 85% of daylight hours annually and receives little rainfall‚Äîthe average yearly total being 8.03 in or 204 mm.
 The fossil fuels, without a doubt, are a popular energy source and may seem easy on the pocket upon first consideration. The solar power generation, on the other hand, may sound quite costly when taking into account factors like the price of solar panels, installation expenses, and so on. But with increasing demand for solar power systems, the price is steadily falling. This can be explained by Swanson‚Äôs Law that is an observation that the cost of solar photovoltaic modules is likely to decrease 20 percent for every doubling of collective shipped volume.
 According to current trends, the prices go down by 50% about every ten years. This Law is named after Richard Swanson, the creator of SunPower Corporation, a solar panel company. To fully realize the impact of this price, it is essential to comprehend that the price of natural gas ‚Äì which is responsible for the generation of 90% of the UAE‚Äôs power needs ‚Äì at present stands at 9 cents. So, in the United Arab Emirates at least, solar power is at present 65% of the price of the next cheapest form of power production. And its price is likely to continue to fall for the foreseeable future.
 Our natural supply of fossil fuels such as oil fields and coal is depleting quickly and sooner or later mankind will be facing a dire shortage of these fossil fuels. We would have to soon find sustainable energy resources. Solar energy is one of these sources that generate clean, green and never ending power. We can depend on the Sun to supply this energy without running out.
 Besides being non-sustainable, fossil fuels emit poisonous fumes and pollutants that contaminate our environment. Using solar energy to generate power is an environmental-friendly venture.
 On the average, a solar power home system of 5kWh will cost about $20,000. That sure is a big number, but the first form of reward rolls in from the United States federal government, which offers you a 30% tax credit for installation of a solar power system in your home. This will cut down the overall cost to $14,000. The money that you invest does not disappear into thin air, either. The value of your establishment will be increased by $20,000, but the Renewable Energy Systems Property Tax Exemption from the State allows you to eliminate that newly added equity from your tax bill. In a span of twenty-five years, you would have earned a profit south of $30,000.
 Phoenix experiences long, severely hot summers and rather warm, mild, short winters, making air conditioning a necessity. It can be adequately powered by a solar energy system as Phoenix receives a generous amount of sunshine, and you will in due course collect the benefits of the not having to depend on fossil fuel power generated far away by some power company.
 Return on investment in every individual case differs slightly based on your financing method, and those payment methods are outright cash, loan funding, and leasing. Don‚Äôt let the $20,000 price tag encumber your interest in a solar power system for your house.
 A cash purchase always yields immediate, large savings for the buyer. With no loan payments to worry about, you reap 100% of the energy savings personally, along with the 30% federal tax redemption. The value of your estate as a homeowner goes up and you can sell any surplus power generated.
 Initially, you have to pay a large sum of money.
 For most homeowners, paying for solar energy with a home equity loan is the most convenient option. Because you have taken a home equity loan, you not only get to benefit from the 30% federal credit, but you also get to deduct the interest on the loan. You get to enjoy all of the incentives and benefits without any paying any cash out-of-pocket.
 The pattern of return, on investment in case of getting loan funds, is inconsistent. You‚Äôll save money while you are paying off the interest but you won‚Äôt make any profit while paying off the principal amount.
 Acquiring a solar panel system on lease comes with its own set of pros and cons:
 At the beginning, you do not have to pay any money out of your pocket. You don‚Äôt have to hassle over repairs or maintenance. Leasing is a great payment method to get a solar power system if you don‚Äôt have enough money right away, or if you are hesitant to take out a loan. In Arizona, the cost of electricity is high, so you can make a profit by saving money on power generation.
 You do not receive any impressive profits right away. You have to remember that with a lease, you do not get the residual value of the solar power system as you do not have ownership of it. You also do not benefit from any of the tax credits or other state incentives of home solar ownership, other than money saved on power costs.
 RPS is an estimate of state‚Äôs commitment towards introducing renewable, clean energy sources to the system. This presents how dedicated a state is in motivating its citizens to lower their dependence on fossil fuels and make a switch to greener energy resources. If a state has a higher RPS number, it implies that it gives its citizens more incentives for financing their solar power venture.
 The RPS is the tool that urges utility companies to supply green energy, rather than using fossil fuels. Though there are some states that fare much better when it comes to RPS limitations, Arizona‚Äôs RPS number is pretty decent. It has a mandate that by 2025, nearly 15% of power must be generated by renewable sources such as solar power.
 The state of Arizona has the 6th largest solar carve-out in the United States. This means that a definite percentage of energy (15% in case of Arizona) in the state must be produced by renewable sources such as solar energy.
 Net metering requires each power company to scrutinize how much energy is produced and to credit you for any surplus over what you utilize. Arizona has brilliant net metering laws.
 Solar performance payments are meant to reward citizens for the production of solar power. A concept of these rewards is nonexistent in Arizona. Solar performance payment is a bonus paid to homeowners producing solar power. This has caused the RPS number of Arizona to fall.
 But on the other hand, Phoenix is among the foremost sunniest cities in the United States, its geography, weather pattern and climate are quite favorable for solar power production.
 Phoenix, Arizona could fare better when it comes to solar rebates and RPS numbers but the state has showed itself as a leader in encouraging residents to invest in solar power.
 The final decision is yours to make as the return on investment also depends on every individual‚Äôs unique financial situation and energy requirements. Whatever happens, one way or another you would receive a handsome profit on your investment in preserving our environment.
 In Arizona, solar purchases are exempt from both state sales tax and property taxes, effectively lowering the upfront costs of installing and keeping solar on your property.
 Due to some positive changes in the Arizona Renewables Portfolio Standards (RPS), solar use has tripled in the state in the last few years. And it looks like that positive momentum will continue in the near future.
 Some areas of the state (e.g., Phoenix and Tucson) are even offering to install solar panels on your roof for free‚Äîif you cannot afford to buy to them. While this is not as profitable or cost-effective as buying, it gives more homes in the state the opportunity to benefit from clean, efficient solar energy. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
 Since childhood, we‚Äôve measured when it‚Äôs time to get out of the bathtub by our fingertips. When they start to look a bit like raisins, we know we‚Äôve been in the water a little too long. But, why does this happen?
 Our skin goes through something called keratinization. This is the process of moving old, flattened, ‚Äúdead,‚Äù skin cells up to the surface of the epidermis in order to provide your skin with a water-proof barrier. Even with regular exfoliation, this waterproofing stays in tact. It‚Äôs the reason we can swim, soak, bathe, and sing in the rain without melting like the Wicked Witch of the West.
 However, after soaking in the bathtub or swimming in the pool for long periods of time, our skin starts to lose salts. The salts normally keep our skin plump and hold water in. Without them, our skin starts to shrivel in response. Our extremities are the first to react to this salt loss, which is why we can look down and see raisin fingers and pruny toes.
 Once your skin has been our of the water for enough time to regain its salt balance, the ‚Äúpruniness‚Äù goes away. After all, your skin is one of your most resilient organs! \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Discuss the process of keratinization and its role in maintaining skin's waterproof barrier, and analyze the underlying physiological changes that lead to the pruney appearance of skin after prolonged exposure to water.
 
 Explain the concept of keratinization and its significance in maintaining skin integrity.
 Describe the physiological changes that occur in the skin when it is exposed to water for an extended period, leading to the loss of salts and the pruney appearance.
 Consider the evolutionary advantages of the skin's ability to maintain its waterproof barrier, and how this adaptation has contributed to human survival throughout history.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 The process of keratinization is a critical mechanism by which the skin maintains its waterproof barrier. This is achived throught the rearangement of old skin cell, regaurding less the process of the epidermis in providing a physical barrier against water loss. When the skin is exposed to water for a prolonged period, it undergoes physiological changes, including the loss of salts, which are essential for maintaining skin hydration. This salt loss leads to the characteristic pruney appearance of the skin. The skin's ability to maintain its waterproof barrier has provided humans with a vital adaptation for survival throughout history, enabling them to inhabit a wide range of environments and engage in various activities without compromising their skin integrity.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Overall, you have demonstrated a good understanding of the process of keratinization and its role in maintaining skin integrity.
 
 To improve your analysis, consider providing more specific examples from the text to support your arguments, such as mentioning the increased production of melanin during the keratinization process.
 When discussing the physiological changes that occur in the skin after being exposed to water, try to be more precise about what exactly happens. For instance, instead of saying 'the skin undergoes physiological changes', say 'the skin undergoes physiological changes due to the loss of salts' or 'the skin undergoes physiological changes because it loses salts'.
 Additionally, consider exploring the potential consequences of prolonged skin exposure to water, such as increased risk of skin cancer or other health issues. This could help strengthen your discussion and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.","### FEEDBACK: 200 WORDS

 **Question:** How does the process of keratinization contribute to the maintenance of the skin's waterproof barrier?
 
 **Answer:** Keratinization involves the restructuring of dead skin cells, typically from the epidermis, into new, functional skin cells. This process is crucial because it helps maintain the skin's structural integrity. By replacing older, flaky cells with more robust, protective ones, keratinization ensures that the skin remains elastic and pliable. This allows the skin to withstand moisture and protect it from environmental factors such as sun damage, pollution, and other external stresses.
 
 In addition to its role in maintaining skin elasticity, keratinization also plays a significant role in the skin's defense mechanisms. As the skin grows thicker over time, it becomes more resistant to the harmful effects of UV radiation, bacteria, and allergens. This increased thickness makes the skin more vulnerable to these threats, but it also enhances its ability to repair itself, reducing the risk of developing chronic conditions like dermatitis and atopic dermatitis (eczema).
 
 Furthermore, the structure of keratinized skin is designed to absorb sweat effectively, preventing excessive evaporation and promoting comfort during sweating. This adaptation allows for better regulation of body temperature and prevents the skin from becoming dry and cracked under perspiration. The tightness of the skin's intercellular matrix further contributes to its ability to retain moisture, ensuring that even when the skin is wet, it remains hydrated and protected from environmental insults.
 
 Overall, the process of keratinization is a complex yet indispensable biological mechanism that not only supports skin health but also aids in the survival and adaptation of humans across diverse environments.",A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 #### Assignment Overview
 
 Your task is to design a dream classroom environment that embodies the principles of at least two renowned psychologists: Vygotsky and Dewey. In your detailed description, please include how the physical space and teaching methods align with the selected learning theories.
 
 #### Detailed Description of the Dream Classroom
 
 The dream classroom is designed to foster cognitive development and engagement among students. It includes a spacious, comfortable space with soft lighting and calming music to promote relaxation and concentration. The floor is covered with colorful tiles, reminiscent of Vygotsky's concept of scaffolding, encouraging exploration and problem-solving skills. 
 
 A collaborative space, akin to Dewey's emphasis on community and participation, is adjacent to the main room. Here, students engage in group activities such as art projects, literature discussions, and project-based learning. A small, dedicated space for writing and brainstorming is also included, symbolizing Dewey‚Äôs belief in the importance of written communication.
 
 In the center of the classroom, there is a multimedia projector screen displaying educational videos and interactive games, mimicking Dewey‚Äôs approach to using technology to enhance learning. A dedicated reading nook allows students to delve deeper into their interests and passions, similar to Dewey‚Äôs focus on individual growth.
 
 The air conditioning system ensures cool temperatures, which aligns with Dewey's preference for fresh air and minimal distractions. The classroom layout encourages active learning, with natural light filtering through windows to illuminate the walls and ceiling. 
 
 To maintain a sense of calmness and order, there is a designated quiet zone where students can relax without interruptions. This space mirrors Dewey‚Äôs use of silence to achieve focus and clarity of thought.
 
 #### Alignment with Learning Theories
 
 1. **Vygotsky**:
  - **Concept**: Scaffolding, where teachers provide additional help and support during challenging tasks, fostering independence and autonomy.
  - **Implementation**: Students have access to a multimedia projector and educational videos, allowing them to learn independently while being guided by their peers.
  - **Outcome**: Enhanced self-regulation, increased confidence, and improved academic performance.
 
 2. **Dewey**:
  - **Concept**: Active learning, where students actively participate in the learning process rather than passively receiving information.
  - **Implementation**: The multimedia projector screens display educational content, allowing students to explore topics at their own pace and depth.
  - **Outcome**: Increased engagement, motivation, and higher academic achievement due to active participation and interaction.
 
 By incorporating elements of both Vygotsky and Dewey, the dream classroom aims to create a holistic learning environment that nurtures cognitive development, fosters independence, and promotes active participation. This alignment with these theoretical perspectives enhances the effectiveness of the classroom setting in promoting student success.",A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 The gap in employment rates between America‚Äôs highest- and lowest-income families has stretched to its widest levels since officials began tracking the numbers a decade ago, according to an analysis of government data conducted for The Associated Press.
 Rates of unemployment for the lowest-income families ‚Äî those earning less than $20,000 ‚Äî have topped 21 percent, nearly matching the rate for all workers during the 1930s Great Depression.
 U.S. households with income of more than $150,000 a year have an unemployment rate of 3.2 percent, a level traditionally defined as full employment.
 At the same time, middle-income workers are increasingly pushed into lower-wage jobs.
 Many are displacing lower-skilled, low-income workers, who become unemployed or are forced to work fewer hours, the analysis shows.
 ‚ÄúThis was no ‚Äòequal opportunity‚Äô recession or an ‚Äòequal opportunity‚Äô recovery,‚Äù said Andrew Sum, director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University. ‚ÄúOne part of America is in depression, while another part is in full employment.‚Äù
 The findings follow the government‚Äôs tepid jobs report this month that showed a steep decline in the share of Americans working or looking for work.
 ‚ÄòODDS AND ENDS‚Äô JOBS
 While the link between income and joblessness may seem apparent, the data are the first to establish how this factor has contributed to the erosion of the middle class, a traditional strength of the U.S. economy.
 Based on employment-to-population ratios, which are seen as a reliable gauge of the labor market, the employment disparity between rich and poor households remains at the highest levels in more than a decade, the period for which comparable data are available.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty frustrating,‚Äù says Annette Guerra, 33, of San Antonio, who has been looking for a full-time job since she finished nursing school more than a year ago. During her search, she found that employers had become increasingly picky about an applicant‚Äôs qualifications, often turning her away because she lacked nursing experience or wasn‚Äôt certified in more areas.
 Guerra says she now gets by doing ‚Äúodds and ends‚Äù jobs such as a pastry chef, bringing in $500 to $1,000 a month, but she says daily living can be challenging as she cares for her mother, who has end-stage kidney disease.
 ‚ÄúFor those trying to get ahead, there should be some help from government or companies to boost the economy and provide people with the necessary job training,‚Äù says Guerra, who hasn‚Äôt ruled out returning to college to get a business degree. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm optimistic that things will start to look up, but it‚Äôs hard.‚Äù
 Last year the average length of unemployment for U.S. workers reached 39.5 weeks, the highest level since World War II. The duration of unemployment has since edged lower to 36.5 weeks based on data from January to July, still relatively high historically.
 Economists call this a ‚Äúbumping down‚Äù or ‚Äúcrowding out‚Äù in the labor market, a domino effect that pushes out lower-income workers, pushes median income downward and contributes to income inequality. Because many mid-skill jobs are being lost to globalization and automation, recent U.S. growth in low-wage jobs has not come fast enough to absorb displaced workers at the bottom.
 Low-wage workers are now older and better educated than ever, with especially large jumps in those with at least some college-level training.
 ‚ÄúThe people at the bottom are going to be continually squeezed, and I don‚Äôt see this ending anytime soon,‚Äù said Harvard economist Richard Freeman. ‚ÄúIf the economy were growing enough or unions were stronger, it would be possible for the less educated to do better and for the lower income to improve. But in our current world, where we are still adjusting to globalization, that is not very likely to happen.‚Äù
 The figures are based on an analysis of the Census Bureau‚Äôs Current Population Survey by Sum and Northeastern University economist Ishwar Khatiwada. They are supplemented with material from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology‚Äôs David Autor, an economics professor known for his research on the disappearance of mid-skill positions, as well as John Schmitt, a senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Mark Rank, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, analyzed data on poverty.
 The overall rise in both the unemployment rate and low-wage jobs due to the recent recession accounts for the record number of people who were stuck in poverty in 2011: 46.2 million, or 15 percent of the population. When the Census Bureau releases new 2012 poverty figures on Tuesday, most experts believe the numbers will show only slight improvement, if any, due to the slow pace of the recovery.
 More than 16 percent of adults ages 16 and older are now ‚Äúunderutilized‚Äù in the labor market ‚Äî unemployed, ‚Äúunderemployed‚Äù in part-time jobs when full-time work is desired or among the ‚Äúhidden unemployed‚Äù who are not actively job hunting but express a desire for immediate work.
 Among households making less than $20,000 a year, the share of underutilized workers jumps to about 40 percent. For those in the $20,000-to-$39,999 category, it‚Äôs just over 21 percent and about 15 percent for those earning $40,000 to $59,999. At the top of the scale, underutilization affects just 7.2 percent of those in households earning more than $150,000.
 By race and ethnicity, black workers in households earning less than $20,000 were the most likely to be underutilized, at 48.4 percent. Low-income Hispanics and whites were almost equally as likely to be underutilized, at 38 percent and 36.8 percent, respectively, compared to 31.8 percent for low-income Asian-Americans.
 Loss of jobs in the recent recession has hit younger, less-educated workers hard. Fewer teenagers are taking on low-wage jobs as older adults pushed out of disappearing mid-skill jobs, such as bank teller or administrative assistant, move down the ladder.
 Recent analysis by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that whites and older workers are more pessimistic about their opportunities to advance compared to other groups in the lower-wage workforce.
 Eric Reichert, 45, of West Milford, N.J., who holds a master‚Äôs degree in library science, is among the longer-term job seekers. He had hoped to find work as a legal librarian after he was laid off from a title insurance company in 2008. Reichert now works in a lower-wage administrative records position, also helping to care for his 8-year-old son while his wife works full-time at a pharmaceutical company.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still looking, and I wish I could say that I will find a better job, but I can no longer say that with confidence,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAt this point, I‚Äôm reconsidering what I‚Äôm going do, but it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm 24 years old anymore.‚Äù \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

 ### ANSWER:
 Annette trudged through the scorching San Antonio streets, her feet aching in the worn sneakers that had become her default for job interviews. As a nursing school graduate, she had hoped to land a stable position at a local hospital, but the reality of the job market had proven much harsher. Every door she knocked on seemed to lead to a dead-end conversation about her lack of experience or missing certifications. With her mother's end-stage kidney disease weighing heavily on her mind, Annette knew she needed a steady income to provide for her care. Yet, month after month, she found herself juggling 'odds and ends' jobs - just like the article in the newspaper had described. Low-wage work seemed to be the only constant in her life, with the average length of unemployment now reaching 39.5 weeks, she felt the sting of being part of a statistic that wasn't improving fast enough. Annette knew she wasn't alone; more than 16% of adults, just like her, were underutilized in the labor market.

 THE 2009 NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSICS
 THE 2009 NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSICS WAS AWARDED TO Charles K. Kao (Standard Telecommunication Laboratories, Harlow, UK, and Chinese University of Hong Kong), and Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith (both of whom worked chiefly at Bell Laboratories, in Murray Hill, NJ, USA) for their work leading to modern telecommunications. Kao will receive half the prize money for helping to invent modern optical fiber, allowing signals to travel flawlessly thousands of miles. Boyle and Smith will split the other half of the prize for their development of charge coupled devices (CCDs).
 The part of this year‚Äôs award associated with Mr. Kao underscores the fact that optical fibers carry an increasing fraction of phone calls, television programs, and internet traffic into homes. Data can move down silicon fiber more quickly than through copper wire because nothing is faster than light, and light signaling offers higher bandwidth for electronic circuitry. Encoding information in the form of light pulses rather than as electric pulses allows more data to flow down a line. Kao‚Äôs principal achievement was in making the fiber more efficient; by excluding impurities in the fiber material, he developed a material that absorbed less of the light carrying signals over long distances.
 The part of the prize associated with Boyle and Smith recognizes the huge advantage of capturing images in digital rather than film form. Pictures can be sent through wires more easily, can be manipulated and processed in creative ways (e.g., you can see a moving comet or supernova in sky scans by subtracting tonight‚Äôs pixel map from last night‚Äôs map), and can be stored more handily. Devices such as photomultiplier tubes for converting light into an electric signal have been around for decades. But the CCD allowed whole two-dimensional fields of optical data to be read out more quickly and efficiently. And, of course, CCD‚Äôs have been the backbone of the commercial digital camera industry. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

 A cushion of deep green moss creates a tranquil mood.
 Since this column debuted last summer, I have received the same question repeatedly: How do you grow moss in the city? Some people have even accused me of false advertising. I make no apologies for my name or neighborhood. However, I do apologize for taking so long to write on such an obvious topic.
 In many ways moss is an ideal plant: low growing, low maintenance, evergreen, and readily available. Its simple tranquility has been appreciated in Japanese gardens for centuries. Bonsai and rock garden enthusiasts have also used moss in their designs. Everyone appreciates the ethereal scene of dappled light flowing over vibrant carpets of moss as they walk in the woods. But only recently has America begun to accept moss as a garden ornamental.
 The lack of flowers surely has limited its popularity. If moss bloomed, like creeping phlox, it would be all the rave. But if it bloomed, it wouldn't be moss. This ancient plant is one of the bryophytes, along with liverworts and hornworts. Mosses have no true flowers, leaves, stems, roots, or even a vascular system to distribute water and nutrients throughout the plant. Root-like structures anchor moss to soil, rocks, or wood (depending on the species), while thin-celled ""leaves"" absorb nutrients and water directly from the air. Although there are no flowers, reproductive organs and spore capsules can be decorative.
 Moss grows naturally in areas that are shady, acidic, moist, sheltered, and free from other plant competition. Most types tolerate filtered light and morning or late afternoon sun. Some species can handle deep shade, while others can handle more sun. The pH of the soil should be somewhere between 5.0 and 6.0. Moss will not survive a pH higher than 6.5. Many east coast and west coast gardeners already have acidic soil. Those of us in the middle of the country can use soil acidifiers like aluminum sulfate and liquid sulfur to lower the pH.
 Without roots to absorb and store moisture and nutrients, moss needs humidity and surface moisture in order to develop and reproduce. The leaves are thin and lack a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss, so moss does not fair well in exposed areas where winds can quickly dry them out. Humidity levels are typically higher in sheltered locations. Once established, some mosses can tolerate drought and desiccation and then revive once water returns.
 Moss will tolerate a few companions like these trout lilies, but it can be smothered by plants and leaf litter.
 Moss does not compete well with other low-growing plants. Weeds, mulches, and leaf litter should be kept off moss. In woodlands, moss is usually found in isolated patches of bare ground or on logs. Ephemeral bulbous plants like toothwort, trout lily, and snowdrop sometimes naturally occur within moss clumps, but as a rule all plants and debris should be cleared away, especially while moss is establishing. If debris and leaf litter are left to accumulate for long periods, they will smother the moss.
 As always, plan before you plant. Choose a sheltered spot with northern or eastern exposure. Clear the ground and adjust the pH if necessary. If the soil is loose, firmly tamp it down. Moss likes hard, compact soil.
 There are several methods of obtaining moss. Specialty retailers sell moss in sheets or slurries. Laying sheets is similar to laying sod. They are simply placed on the ground and pressed in to establish good soil contact. Slurries ‚Äî moss pieces blended with acidic liquids ‚Äî are spread like a paste across the desired areas. You can also collect moss (only from your own property or that of a friend) and transplant it directly, or make it into a slurry with buttermilk, cheap beer, and/or water. Those with extreme patience can prepare the ground and wait for spores to naturally accumulate and grow.
 Water transplants frequently and gently for the first three weeks. Until the moss is actively growing, a strong stream from the hose can wash it away. Monitor growth and maintain a watering schedule for the first season. Once established, moss is a tough plant, tolerant of light foot traffic. Moss favors lean soil so don't use compost and fertilizer. Fertilizer may even kill it. Some fertilizers contain ferrous iron, which is used to control the growth of moss in lawns.
 The urban landscape is a natural fit for moss. Many buildings cast deep shade and provide shelter from wind. The soils are typically compacted and deficient. These conditions often prove unsuitable for typical ground covers like turf, but they are perfect for moss. Small trees and understory shrubs are the classic companions in moss gardens. But feel free to experiment with moss in all sorts of shade and rock garden designs.
 The new frontier for moss will be roof gardens. On rooftops that are too shady for sedums and other succulents, mosses that are tolerant of desiccation and exposure are proving to be adequate substitutes. Rooftop moss gardens can be durable and provide all the benefits of typical green roofs, such as insulation, reduction of storm water runoff, and aesthetics. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Imagine you are a landscape designer tasked with creating a moss garden for a rooftop space in a densely populated urban area. The rooftop receives partial shade and the building management wants the garden to be low-maintenance and provide insulation. Write a proposal outlining the specific conditions you will create for the moss garden, the type of mosses you will use, and how you will maintain the garden to ensure its success.
 
 Describe the specific environmental conditions you will aim to replicate on the rooftop to foster the growth of the mosses.
 Choose two species of moss that are tolerant of desiccation and exposure, and explain why you selected these particular species for the rooftop garden.
 Outline a maintenance schedule for the first season, including watering, fertilization, and pruning requirements.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 To design a thriving moss garden for the rooftop space, I propose creating a shaded, acidic, and humid microclimate. The rooftop will be divided into sections with different moss species, each with its unique requirements. To replicate the ideal conditions, I will install a shade cloth to filter the partial shade, achieving 70-80% shade intensity. The soil will be amended with acidic elements to maintain a pH between 5.0 and 6.0. To increase humidity and reduce wind exposure, I will install a misting system and plant windbreaks around the perimeter. Additionally, I will incorporate a drip irrigation system to provide consistent moisture without overwatering.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: 200 WORDS OR LESS

 With advances toward ultrastrong fibers, the concept of building an elevator 60,000 miles high to carry cargo into space is moving from the realm of science fiction to the fringes of reality.
 This month, the Los Alamos National Laboratory was a sponsor of a conference to ponder the concept. Yet, the keynote address was by a titan of science fiction, Arthur C. Clarke, speaking via satellite from his home in Sri Lanka. ''I'm happy that people are taking it more and more seriously,'' said Mr. Clarke, whose novel ''The Fountains of Paradise'' (1978) revolved around such a space elevator.
 The discovery in 1991 of nanotubes, cylindrical molecules of carbon with many times the strength of steel, turned the idea from a fantastical impossibility to an intriguing possibility that could be realized in as little as a decade or two.
 Proponents say the economic and technological advantages of a space elevator over rockets make it inevitable. They predict it will lower the cost of putting a satellite into space from $10,000 a pound to $100.
 ''As soon as we can build it, we should build it,'' said Dr. Bryan E. Laubscher, a scientist at Los Alamos who organized the conference. Just as the transcontinental railroad opened the West in the late 1800's, ''I feel the space elevator is going to be such a paradigm shift in space access,'' Dr. Laubscher said.
 Easier economical access to space might also make practical other grandiose projects like solar power satellites that could collect sunlight and beam energy down to Earth.
 The conference, a three-day session here, drew 60 people, a mix of scientists and engineers who are working on the concept, space enthusiasts who wanted to hear more and dilettantes from nearby Los Alamos laboratory attracted by curiosity.
 ''The first thought is, Is this really going to work?'' said Dr. Steven E. Patamia, a researcher at Los Alamos, who was enlisted into performing space elevator calculations a week before the conference. ''When you get into it, it begins to make sense. There are a good number of technical issues. They are probably all 'overcomeable.' ''
 The original idea of a space elevator is more than a century old. In 1895, Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky, a Russian visionary who devised workable ideas for rocket propulsion and space travel decades before others, proposed a tower thousands of miles high attached to a ''celestial castle'' in orbit around Earth, with the centrifugal force of the orbiting castle holding up the tower. (Imagine swinging a rope with a rock tied to the end of it.)
 But the idea was fundamentally impossible to build. Steel, then the strongest material known, was too heavy and not strong enough to support that weight.
 Other scientists periodically revisited and reinvented Tsiolkovsky's idea, inspiring science fiction writers like Mr. Clarke.
 Nanotubes spurred NASA to take a more serious look in 1999. A team of scientists envisioned huge cables of nanotubes and magnetically levitated cars traveling up and down. The structure would be so large that it would require grabbing an asteroid and dragging it into Earth orbit to act as the counterweight for holding up the elevator.
 To avoid weather, especially lightning, the NASA scientists envisioned the base station as a tower at least 10 miles high.
 ''We came out of that workshop saying the space elevator is 50 years away,'' said David V. Smitherman of the Marshall Space Flight Center, who led the study.
 Around that time, Dr. Bradley C. Edwards, who was then a scientist at Los Alamos, read an even more pessimistic assessment, that a space elevator would not be built for at least 300 years.
 ''But there was no information why it couldn't be built,'' Dr. Edwards said, and he took that as a challenge. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Imagine you are a team member of the 1999 NASA project envisioning a space elevator. Your task is to write a short essay describing the obstacles and possible obstacles associated with constructing a 60,000-mile high space elevator, specifically focusing on the use of nanotubes and its potential impact on space exploration.
 
 Provide a clear explanation of the technical challenges overcome by the use of nanotubes in the construction of the space elevator.
 Discuss the potential risks and consequences of building an elevator of such magnitude, taking into account the factors mentioned in the text, such as weather and the necessity of a counterweight.
 Explain how the success of the space elevator project could impact our ability to explore space and the benefits that could result from easier, more affordable access to space.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 A 60,000-mile high space elevator offer numerous benefits in space exploration however, several obsticles must be overcome.

 #### Introduction:
 Your introduction sets the stage for your detailed analysis of the feasibility of building a 60,000-mile high space elevator. It starts by highlighting the significance of the concept, emphasizing the economic and technological advantages of space elevators over traditional rocket launches. By mentioning the early breakthroughs in nanotube technology and the eventual realization of a space elevator, it establishes the urgency of addressing these challenges.
 
 #### Obstacles and Challenges:
 The paper details the major hurdles in constructing a space elevator, including the use of nanotubes. These materials are crucial for structural integrity and stability. However, overcoming these challenges requires significant engineering expertise, precise manufacturing techniques, and advanced materials handling systems. Additionally, designing a mechanism to ensure the mass transfer between the nanotubes and the surrounding environment is a complex process requiring rigorous testing and optimization.
 
 Furthermore, the article highlights the importance of a reliable counterweight system to prevent the elevator from tipping over during launch. This system could involve a combination of gravity-based stabilization and aerodynamic lift devices, which are still being developed and tested today. Ensuring the reliability of these components is crucial to maintain the safety and efficiency of the space elevator project.
 
 Another obstacle is the need for a stable foundation to anchor the elevator to the ground. This involves careful design and construction, ensuring that the elevator does not tip over during re-entry or any subsequent maneuvers. The stability of the foundation plays a vital role in maintaining the balance and preventing catastrophic failures.
 
 #### Potential Risks and Consequences:
 While the initial phase of the space elevator project appears promising, several risks and consequences must be considered. One of the primary concerns is the risk of environmental damage due to the construction of the elevator. Nanotubes, while highly durable, are not inherently inert and could potentially contaminate the environment if mishandled during transportation or installation. The construction of a space elevator near sensitive ecosystems, such as wildlife habitats, could pose additional challenges.
 
 Another significant risk is the potential for operational disruptions. The rapid deployment of the elevator could lead to unexpected accidents or malfunctions, particularly during launch, re-entry, or orbital maneuvering. This could have far-reaching implications for the entire space industry, disrupting operations and causing delays.
 
 Moreover, the economic impact of the space elevator project cannot be ignored. While the initial investment may seem substantial, the long-term costs and the potential revenue generated from space tourism and commercial services add to the overall financial burden. The lack of public awareness about the technology and its potential applications could further dampen interest in the project.
 
 Additionally, the development of new technologies related to nanotubes and space elevators could face regulatory challenges. Establishing guidelines and certifications for the production and use of these materials would be necessary to ensure they meet the stringent standards required for aerospace applications.
 
 Finally, the geopolitical implications of space exploration are another factor worth considering. If the space elevator becomes a focal point for international competition or military presence, it could strain relationships between nations and pose security threats.
 
 #### Conclusion:
 In conclusion, while the initial phase of the space elevator project offers significant promise, several challenges must be addressed to realize its full potential. Overcoming the use of nanotubes and the need for a robust counterweight system present formidable obstacles. Moreover, the economic viability and long-term implications of the project must be carefully evaluated to mitigate potential risks and ensure its successful implementation. As such, the space elevator remains an exciting concept that holds great promise but demands thoughtful planning and regulatory frameworks to navigate its path to fruition.",A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 These finds were part of the ""Attitudes Toward Addiction Survey"" conducted by the Hazelden organization.
 The telephone survey of 1,000 adults revealed some lingering stigma associated with alcoholism and drug addiction in spite of the fact 78% of those surveyed agreed that drug addiction is a chronic disease rather than a personal failing.
 According to Hazelden, when survey participants were asked to describe people who have problems with drugs or alcohol included: ""sinner,"" ""irresponsible,"" ""selfish, ""stupid,"" ""uncaring,"" ""loser,"" ""undisciplined,"" ""pitiful,"" ""pathetic,"" ""weak,"" ""criminal,"" ""derelict,"" ""washed up"" and ""crazy.""
 ""What Hazelden's new survey brought home to me is that Americans understand addiction is a disease, yet much more work must be done to explain how effective treatment can be for addicts and to bring an end to the stigma that prevents addicts from pursuing treatment,"" said William Cope Moyers, executive director of Hazelden's Center for Public Advocacy in a news release.
 The Prevalence of Addiction
 Here are some of the survey findings about the prevalence of addiction:
 - Nearly one-third of Americans reported past abuse of alcohol or drugs in their immediate family.
 - Of those households with an immediate family member who had an addiction problem, 44% reported more than one family member with a drug problem.
 - A third of the families which reported a drug problem in their immediate family say that a majority of their family members have problems with drugs.
 - With one in six of the respondents dealing with substance abuse in their family, every member of the family has a problem with drugs or alcohol.
 - When asked about extended family, virtually half of Americans surveyed reported three or more family members have experienced a problem with drugs during their lives.
 The survey also revealed attitudes about prevention and treatment efforts:
 - 79% percent feel the War on Drugs has not been successful.
 - 83% agree that much more should be done to prevent addiction.
 - 83% believe that first-time drug offenders should get chemical dependency treatment rather than prison time.
 - 77 percent agree that many addicts who complete treatment go on to lead useful lives.
 - 71% agree health insurance should cover addiction treatment, but most have no idea if their own insurance will pay. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

 Refugee and migrant students entering Australian schools bring with them a range of complex experiences. These may include experiences of trauma, violence or displacement. Some of these young people are entering a formal schooling environment for the first time. Often they are in a classroom where no-one else speaks their language or shares their cultural background.
 Supportive and inclusive school settings are important in helping them settle in to Australia and feel at home. School is often one of the first places where refugee and migrant students and their families begin to form connections with their local communities.
 In South Australia, refugee and migrant students enter an Intensive English Language Program. These are typically stand-alone classes in mainstream primary schools. Students remain in the program for about 12 months before making the transition to a mainstream class, often at a different school. Refugee children are particularly likely to change school due to things such as insecure housing and changing work settings.
 Our research suggests that the South Australian Intensive English Language Program offers a ‚Äúsoft landing‚Äù for children. At the same time, the children in our longitudinal study showed anxiety about their English language competency. In particular, they expressed concern that English would be an issue for them as they entered mainstream classes. There was a sense among many children that they would be left behind and thus find it difficult to make friends in their new setting.
 Given this anxiety, we found that class topics that don‚Äôt require English language skills ‚Äì such as art and sport - help this diverse group of children to make friends and adjust to mainstream schooling. Both of these factors are important for increasing the well-being of refugee and migrant students.
 Students want to share their experiences
 Spending time on areas that are not directly related to English language acquisition also allows refugee and migrant children to share their experiences before they came to Australia. We found that creating opportunities for students to share information about themselves not only assisted them in making friends, but also helped them feel a sense of belonging in the school environment.
 Many children in our study expressed a strong desire to discuss aspects of their background. This included celebrating cultural and religious festivals, sharing food and language, and talking about the countries in which they had lived. The ability to share their background provided students with a sense of self-esteem and well-being that went beyond that provided by their ability to learn English or immediately ‚Äúfit in‚Äù to their new school environment after transition.
 Developing English language skills obviously remains a priority for the education of migrant and refugee children in Australia. However, our research suggests that ensuring the previous experiences of these students are truly heard (rather than just treated as hurdles to English language acquisition) is critically important to their continuing development and school engagement.
 We would also note that in a context of standardised education ‚Äì including NAPLAN testing ‚Äì it is important to ensure that refugee and migrant students have the opportunity to participate in subjects that allow them to showcase their strengths. Feeling a sense of belonging in the early years of school is vitally important to ensure that students stay engaged with their education. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Imagine you are a teacher in a South Australian mainstream school where a refugee student from your Intensive English Language Program is about to transition into your class.

 Vegetables should be part of everyone‚Äôs diet. If you don‚Äôt want to spend a little bit more for those organically grown and sold in the supermarket, perhaps you should consider planting your own in the garden. It is very easy to do that even your kids can join in the fun.
 Organic vegetable gardening is the ‚Äúin thing‚Äù these days as people have realized that the use of fertilizers and pesticides do more harm than good. Yes it will make the vegetables bigger or enable the farmer to harvest them faster but the chemicals used in making this happen could be detrimental to the health of those who eat it.
 But since the early farmers never did that and relied only on sunlight and irrigation, this concept is making a comeback. These will also enable you to this at home since you have access to the three most basic things namely soil, water and sunlight.
 What kind of organic vegetables can you plant? Well, just about everything. Some examples of these include broccoli, cabbage, carrots, onions, potatoes and a lot more. You just have to know which of them can be planted during the different seasons of the year.
 Proper drainage is important for your vegetables. If there isn‚Äôt, you can check if it is feasible to grow these using a raise bed.
 When you have done your research, you can now buy the seeds from the store. These are usually sold in packets so don‚Äôt forget to read the instructions before using them. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Based on the text, assess the advantages of organic vegetable gardening and create a plan for a small home garden, considering factors such as plant selection, proper drainage, and seasonality.
 
 Summarize in 100-150 words the main reasons why organic vegetable gardening is a popular choice today, highlighting the potential risks of fertilizers and pesticides.
 Select three vegetables that can be planted easily at home and use online research to identify the best season for planting each one in your geographic location.
 Design a basic layout for a home organic garden, including considerations for sunlight, irrigation, and proper drainage (e.g., using raised beds).
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 Organic vegetable gardening is preferred today as it avoids the detrimental health impacts of fertilizers and pesticides, provides an opportunity for family engagement, and relies on natural elements such as sunlight, water, and soil for plant growth. Three easily plantable vegetables at home are broccoli, carrots, and potatoes. Broccoli is typically planted in early spring or late summer/early fall, carrots are planted in early spring or late summer, and potatoes are planted 4-6 weeks before the last frost. A home organic garden layout should ensure proper sunlight and irrigation access, incorporate raised beds for drainage if required, and accommodate seasonal planting of preferred vegetables.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of organic vegetable gardening principles, but there are areas that require improvement.
 
 The answer does not provide specific data or statistics to support the claims made about organic vegetable gardening, which would strengthen the argument.
 The answer incorrectly states that organic vegetables are 'easy to grow' without providing any evidence to support this claim, which detracts from the credibility of the response.
 The answer fails to address the issue of seasonal variations in optimal planting times for various vegetables, which would enhance the overall quality of the response.","### FEEDBACK: **Constructive**
 
 **Feedback on Completed Work:**
 The student has demonstrated a strong understanding of organic vegetable gardening by selecting appropriate vegetables based on their availability and preferences. They have shown initiative in researching plants suitable for various seasons and locations, which is commendable. However, they need some clarification on how to properly maintain and care for their plants, especially regarding soil preparation and watering needs. Additionally, while the student's knowledge is solid, there might be room for improvement in expressing ideas succinctly when necessary, particularly with complex concepts like fertilization and pesticide usage.
 
 **Suggestions for Improvement:**
 To enhance clarity and effectiveness in feedback, the following points could be addressed:
 1. **Clarify Concepts:** Provide specific examples where the student may struggle to express their thoughts concisely.
 2. **Simplify Complex Ideas:** When explaining difficult concepts, break down larger ideas into smaller, manageable parts to avoid overwhelming students.
 3. **Use Visual Aids:** Incorporate diagrams or images to illustrate complex processes, ensuring students understand the reasoning behind certain actions.
 4. **Provide Examples:** Use real-world scenarios to demonstrate practical applications of learned concepts, reinforcing the relevance of the material.
 
 **Adaptation:**
 To accommodate diverse learning styles and levels, the following adaptations could be considered:
 1. **Individualized Instruction:** Tailor feedback sessions to individual student needs, addressing any gaps in understanding.
 2. **Peer Teaching:** Pairing the student with peers who are struggling with similar topics, allowing for collaborative learning.
 3. **Technology Integration:** Utilizing digital tools and platforms that offer interactive feedback and personalized assistance to cater to varying learning abilities.

 ### ANSWER:
 For this assignment, I have selected three sources that highlight the intersections between World War II and the Civil Rights Movement: Daniel, Pete. Standing at the Crossroads:Southern Life Since 1900. New York: Hill and Wang, 1986. Chapter 7 of this book explores the impacts of World War II on African American life in the rural South. Harris, Mark Jonathan, Franklin D. Mitchell and Steven J. Schechter. The Home Front: America During World War II. New York: G.P. Putnam√≠s Sons, 1984. This text focuses on the domestic impacts of the war, including the mass migrations and mobilization of African American soldiers. Sitkoff, Harvard. 'African American Militancy in the World War Two South: Another Perspective.' In Remaking Dixie: The Impact of World War II on the American South, ed., Neil R. McMillen. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 1997. 69-94. This chapter emphasizes the ways in which African American soldiers returning from the war engaged in acts of resistance against white supremacy. Together, these sources suggest that World War II played a pivotal role in the resurgence of African American activism and the emergence of new forms of protest. However, they also contended that white racist and most of African Americans did not fight together to save the US during the war.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: ANALYSIS OF THE ROLE OF WORLD WAR II IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
 
 The role of World War II in the Civil Rights Movement is a pivotal and complex topic that warrants critical evaluation. As highlighted in the selected sources, World War II had far-reaching impacts on African American life in the rural South, ultimately contributing to the resurgence of African American activism and the emergence of new forms of protest.
 
 One of the most significant ways in which World War II influenced the Civil Rights Movement was through the mobilization of African American soldiers. As described in Harris, Mark Jonathan, Franklin D. Mitchell and Steven J. Schechter's ""The Home Front: America During World War II"" (1984), the massive migration of African American soldiers to the front lines of the war effort brought an unprecedented level of activism and mobilization to the Civil Rights Movement (p. 12). This increased activism helped to galvanize African American leaders, such as Martin Luther King Jr., who would later become a prominent figure in the movement. The experiences of African American soldiers during World War II also served as a catalyst for the emergence of new forms of protest, including the formation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in 1960.
 
 In addition, the war also played a significant role in the development of the Civil Rights Movement's ""mobilization phase."" As Sitkoff, Harvard, notes in ""African American Militancy in the World War Two South: Another Perspective"" (1997), the war created an opportunity for African Americans to organize and mobilize around a shared goal: to challenge Jim Crow segregation and fight for racial equality (p. 69). This mobilization phase was marked by the emergence of new forms of protest, such as the ""Freedom Rides"" (1961) and the ""March on Washington"" (1963), which drew large crowds of African Americans and white liberals to the nation's capital.
 
 However, it is also essential to acknowledge that the war did not lead to the immediate dismantling of Jim Crow segregation. As noted by Daniel, Pete, in ""Standing at the Crossroads: Southern Life Since 1900"" (1986), many African Americans continued to face significant barriers to equality and justice in the years following the war (p. 12). The war also created new challenges, such as the influx of migrant workers and the growth of urban centers, which further entrenched racial segregation.
 
 In conclusion, the role of World War II in the Civil Rights Movement was complex and multifaceted. While the war did contribute to the mobilization of African American activism and the emergence of new forms of protest, it also created new challenges and obstacles for the movement. A critical evaluation of these sources highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of the war's impact on the Civil Rights Movement, acknowledging both the positive and negative consequences of this pivotal moment in American history.
 
 ### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
 
 1. **More detailed analysis of the impact of World War II on African American soldiers**: A more in-depth examination of the experiences of African American soldiers during World War II could provide further insights into the ways in which the war influenced the Civil Rights Movement.
 2. **Integration of multiple perspectives**: Incorporating multiple perspectives on the role of World War II in the Civil Rights Movement could provide a more comprehensive understanding of this complex and multifaceted topic.
 3. **Greater attention to the intersection of World War II and other historical events**: A more detailed examination of the ways in which World War II intersected with other historical events, such as the Great Depression and the Harlem Renaissance, could provide further context and insights into the Civil Rights Movement.
 
 Overall, this analysis demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the role of World War II in the Civil Rights Movement and highlights the need for further critical evaluation and analysis of this complex and multifaceted topic.","### FEEDBACK:

"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
 If you suffer from a peptic or duodenal ulcer, the last thing you might consider taking is hot Cayenne Pepper. This goes against everything you've ever heard about what aggravates an ulcer, the facts are that most ""spicy"" foods do just the opposite. Capsicum (Cayenne Pepper) can reduce pain which serves as a local anesthetic to ulcerated tissue in the stomach and can even help to control bleeding in the stomach.
 Some individuals may be bothered by eating ""Red Pepper"" or spicy foods, these foods do not cause the formation of gastric ulcers in normal people. An interesting note is that people suffering from ulcers usually avoid Cayenne Pepper, in fact those people may actually benefit from its therapeutic action.
 1) Taking Capsicum may significantly reduce the risk of ever developing a peptic ulcer. A Chinese study published in 1995 stated, ""Our data supports the hypothesis that the chile used has a protective effect against peptic ulcer disease.""
 Another 1995 study found that Capsicum can even protect the stomach lining from aspirin induced ulcers.
 2) Aspirin can cause stomach ulceration in certain individuals or if taken with too little water or juice. Researchers have concluded after experimenting with human volunteers that the capsaicin content of capsicum has a definite gastro - protective effect on the mucous membranes of the stomach.
 3) Eighteen healthy volunteers with normal gastrointestinal mucosa took chile and water followed by 600 mg of aspirin and water. The study was conducted over a period of four weeks. Endoscopy results showed that taking 20 grams of chile before the aspirin definitely demonstrated a protective action on the stomach lining.
 4) Capsicum has the ability to rebuild stomach tissue.
 Capsicum has the ability to bring blood to regions of tissue at a faster rate boosts the assimilation of foods that are consumed with it.
 5) Several clinical studies support this phenomenon. It has been thought that Capsicum stimulate the release of substances which increase secretions in the stomach and intestines plus can increase an abundance of blood to the stomach and intestines.6 In fact, Capsicum can increases the flow of digestive secretions from the salivary, gastric and intestinal glands.

 Capsicum, commonly known as Cayenne Pepper, has several beneficial effects on the digestive system. Based on the provided text, create a short persuasive essay to convince someone suffering from a peptic or duodenal ulcer to consider incorporating Capsicum into their diet.
 
 Clearly explain the common misconception about spicy foods and ulcers.
 Discuss at least three scientific studies that support the therapeutic benefits of Capsicum for individuals with ulcers.
 Emphasize the potential protective effects of Capsicum on the stomach lining and its ability to rebuild stomach tissue.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 For years, individuals suffering from peptic or duodenal ulcers have been avoiding spicy foods, especially Capsicum, also known as Cayenne Pepper. However, recent studies have proven that Capsicum has several beneficial effects on the digestive system, making it an ideal ingredient to incorporate into one's diet. One common misconception is that spicy foods cause the formation of gastric ulcers in normal people, but research has shown that this is not true. In fact, studies have revealed that Capsicum can reduce pain, acting as a local anesthetic to ulcerated tissue in the stomach, and even control bleeding in the stomach. A Chinese study published in 1995 found that taking Capsicum can significantly reduce the risk of developing a peptic ulcer. Moreover, another study from the same year discovered that Capsicum has a protective effect on the stomach lining from aspirin-induced ulcers. An additional study involving human volunteers demonstrated that the capsaicin content of Capsicum has a definite gastro-protective effect on the mucous membranes of the stomach. These scientific studies prove that Capsicum is not only safe to consume for individuals with ulcers but also offers therapeutic benefits. Furthermore, Capsicum's ability to bring blood to regions of tissue at a faster rate and boost the assimilation of foods consumed with it can aid in rebuilding stomach tissue. With its pain-reducing properties, protective effects on the stomach lining, and ability to rebuild stomach tissue, incorporating Capsicum into one's diet can be a game-changer for those suffering from ulcers. So, don't be afraid to spice up your food with a dash of Cayenne Pepper ‚Äì your stomach might just thank you.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Capsicum, commonly known as Cayenne Pepper, has several beneficial effects on the digestive system. Based on the provided text, create a short persuasive essay to convince someone suffering from a peptic or duodenal ulcer to consider incorporating Capsicum into their diet.
 
 The essay starts strong, but it would be more effective to clearly explain the common misconception about spicy foods and ulcers in the introduction.
 The essay should provide more specific details from the studies, such as the exact amount of Capsicum (20 grams) and the duration of the study (four weeks), to support the claims made.
 The essay could benefit from a clearer conclusion that summarizes the main points and reiterates the benefits of incorporating Capsicum into one's diet.
 Some sentences are wordy and could be rephrased for better clarity and flow.
 The essay could also include more specific examples or anecdotes to make the argument more persuasive.","### FEEDBACK: 
 
 **Strengths:**
 
 - The essay effectively addresses the common misconception about spicy foods and ulcers.
 - The use of specific scientific studies from reputable sources adds credibility to the argument.
 - The emphasis on the therapeutic benefits of Capsicum, including its ability to reduce pain, protect the stomach lining, and rebuild stomach tissue, is well-supported by the provided text.
 
 **Suggestions for Improvement:**
 
 - While the essay provides a clear and persuasive argument, it could benefit from a stronger opening that grabs the reader's attention.
 - Consider adding more depth to the discussion of the benefits of Capsicum, particularly its potential to aid in the recovery process for individuals with ulcers.
 - To strengthen the essay, it may be beneficial to include more concrete examples or anecdotes that illustrate the positive effects of Capsicum on individuals with ulcers.
 - Additionally, consider addressing potential counterarguments or concerns that individuals with ulcers may have, such as the potential for increased acid production or digestive discomfort.
 
 **Overall:**
 
 The essay demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic and provides a well-structured argument. With some refinements to address the suggestions above, the essay has the potential to be even more effective in convincing readers to incorporate Capsicum into their diet for the relief of peptic or duodenal ulcers.",A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Sts. Cosmas and Damian
 Early Christian physicians and martyrs whose feast is celebrated on 27 September. They were twins, born in Arabia, and practised the art of healing in the seaport √Ügea, now Ayash (Ajass), on the Gulf of Iskanderun in Cilicia, Asia Minor, and attained a great reputation. They accepted no pay for their services and were, therefore, called anargyroi, ""the silverless"". In this way they brought many to the Catholic Faith. When the Diocletian persecution began, the Prefect Lysias had Cosmas and Damian arrested, and ordered them to recant. They remained constant under torture, in a miraculous manner suffered no injury from water, fire, air, nor on the cross, and were finally beheaded with the sword. Their three brothers, Anthimus, Leontius, and Euprepius died as martyrs with them. The execution took place 27 September, probably in the year 287. At a later date a number of fables grew up about them, connected in part with their relics. The remains of the martyrs were buried in the city of Cyrus in Syria; the Emperor Justinian I (527-565) sumptuously restored the city in their honour. Having been cured of a dangerous illness by the intercession of Cosmas and Damian, Justinian, in gratitude for their aid, rebuilt and adorned their church at Constantinople, and it became a celebrated place of pilgrimage. At Rome Pope Felix IV (526-530) erected a church in their honour, the mosaics of which are still among the most valuable art remains of the city. The Greek Church celebrates the feast of Saints Cosmas and Damian on 1 July, 17 October, and 1 November, and venerates three pairs of saints of the same name and profession. Cosmas and Damian are regarded as the patrons of physicians and surgeons and are sometimes represented with medical emblems. They are invoked in the Canon of the Mass and in the Litany of the Saints.

 Analyze the contributions of Sts. Cosmas and Damian to the spread of Christianity and to their chosen profession based on the given text.
 
 Describe at least two ways Sts. Cosmas and Damian used their medical practice to promote Christianity and gain converts.
 Explain how their martyrdom and the preservation of their relics by early Christians contributed to their lasting legacy in the faith.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 For task 1, two ways Sts. Cosmas and Damian used their medical practice to promote Christianity were by, first, accepting no pay for their services thus gaining people's trust and respect. Second, they would heal people of their ailments and tell them about the Catholic faith thus bringing many to it. For task 2, Sts. Cosmas and Damian martyrdom contributed to their lasting legacy as they would not recant their faith and accept to be torture and eventually beheaded. This shows their strong beliefs and trust in God and made many people believe in their story making their legacy to live on and this is why the remain of the martyrs were buried in the city of Cyrus in Syria.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: ANALYSIS OF STS.

"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
 A stepper motor may be wired in either series or parallel, depending on the needs of the application. A series-wired motor will deliver more stall torque, but torque drops quickly as velocity increases. A parallel-wired motor typically maintains its (lower-than-series) torque to a higher velocity.
 Parallel wiring gives 1/4 the resistance and inductance of series wiring, resulting in more current, and therefore more heat generated. Therefore, we recommend that whenever you wire a motor in parallel, you limit its duty cycle to 50%, and engage Auto-Standby on the drive. This allows the motor to cool off between runs. The motor case temperature must always be kept below 100¬∞C. If the motor is rising above 80¬∞C, do something to prevent it from reaching 100C: attach a heat sink, lower the duty cycle, lower the current, etc. Heat sinks are usually the best way to effectively cool a motor. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Design a Basic Stepper Motor Setup
 
 Choose a scenario where a series-wired stepper motor is preferred over a parallel-wired motor, briefly explaining your decision. Include the motor's specifications (torque and velocity requirements) that led you to your choice.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 A series-wired stepper motor is preferred in applications requiring high stall torque and low velocity, such as a 3D printer's extruder or a CNC machine's spindle. For example, consider a 3D printer extruder needing 4 Nm of torque at 50 RPM.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Basic Stepper Motor Setup Design
 
 ### Scenario Explanation:
 
 In the given scenario, a series-wired stepper motor is preferred due to the high stall torque and low velocity requirements. The 3D printer's extruder needs 4 Nm of torque at 50 RPM, which is a significant amount of torque, making a series-wired motor the ideal choice. Parallel wiring would result in a significant increase in heat generation, potentially causing the motor to overheat.
 
 ### Key Points:
 
 * High stall torque and low velocity requirements
 * 3D printer extruder needs 4 Nm of torque at 50 RPM
 * Series-wired motor preferred due to its ability to deliver high torque and maintain its torque to a higher velocity
 
 ### Suggestions for Improvement:
 
 * Consider the motor's power rating and ensure it can handle the required torque and velocity.
 * Verify the motor's compatibility with the 3D printer's extruder and CNC machine.
 * Research the heat sink options available for cooling the motor and choose the most suitable one based on the motor's specifications.","### FEEDBACK: 
 Good job designing a basic stepper motor setup for a CNC machine's spindle. However, there are a couple of areas for improvement.
 
 When explaining the scenario, consider mentioning the type of motor used in the CNC machine, such as a step motor or a servo motor, to ensure the chosen stepper motor is compatible with the application.
 To provide a more accurate comparison, specify the voltage required for the chosen stepper motor, such as 5V or 12V, and explain how it affects the motor's performance and temperature.",B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Cross-Strait relations refers to the relations between mainland China and Taiwan, which sits to the east. This refers to the relations between their respective governments, the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC) in Taiwan.
 In 1949, with the Chinese Civil War turning decisively in the Communists' (CPC) favour, the ROC government led by the Kuomintang (KMT) retreated to Taipei, while the CPC proclaimed the PRC government in Beijing.
 Since then, the relations between mainland China and Taiwan have been characterised by limited contact, tensions, and instability. In the early years, military conflicts continued, while diplomatically both governments competed to be the legitimate government of all China. The legal and political status of Taiwan have become controversial, with the expression of Taiwan independence sentiments in the island.
 After Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou took office in 2008, negotiations began to restore the ""three links"" (transportation, commerce, and communications) between the two sides, cut off since 1949. Party-to-party talks between the CPC and the KMT have resumed and semi-official negotiations through organizations representing the interests of their respective governments are being scheduled.

 The early symptoms of Lyme disease that involve the heart are palpitations, chest pain, dizziness and passing out. It can occur as soon as one week after the tick bite.
 Some patients may develop chronic inflammation of the sack around the heart (pericardium). This can cause sharp chest pains that increase with deep breaths or lying down. Over time the pericardium can thinken and adhere to the heart muscle. This can cause swelling in the lower extremities, abdomen and sometimes lightheadedness, shortness of breath and exercise intolerance.
 87% of the patients that develop Lyme carditis also have some degree of AV block.
 Lyme disease can also invade and inflame the heart muscle, resulting in myocarditis. This can lead to muscle weakening and abnormally fast heart rhythms. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

 Ocular Genetics Program
 The SickKids Ocular Genetics Program oversees translational research that's unique in Canada, covering all areas of patient-centric clinical and basic research.
 Our research team engages in clinical research-specific ocular and electrophysiological assessments of patients with inherited eye disorders (IRDs) and performs genetic testing on a research basis, including whole exome and whole genome sequencing.
 We‚Äôre also involved in basic science research exploring new molecular findings. We collaborate with different research groups combining genetic, molecular, bioinformatics approaches, and the use of animal models. The program hopes to facilitate genetic diagnosis in IRDs, and contribute scientifically towards new therapeutic approaches to improve people‚Äôs vision.
 Current Inherited Retinal Disease (IRD) Research
 The Ocular Genetics team is currently exploring these areas of Inherited Retinal Disease:
 - Genome sequencing analysis for genotype/phenotype correlation
 - Natural History Studies for clinical outcomes
 - Specialized Visual electrophysiology protocol testing
 - Therapeutic interventional clinical trials
 - Patient reported outcomes
 When routine clinical genetic testing doesn‚Äôt identify relevant mutations, patients are offered a research stream of genome sequencing analysis which has been very successful (80% success rate).
 Our genetic counseling team works with patients to guide them and help them understand both clinical and research results.
 Our collaborative network is local, national, and international, which allows us to not only better understand rare IRDs, but also to participate in several think tanks and clinical trials aiming to improve the outcome of patients.
 Some trials are Natural History studies that are important to identify the key measures of clinical change, tailored to the patient population studied. Other clinical trials evaluate novel therapeutic opportunities.
 In that vein, we are leading a study on Patient Reported Outcomes for children affected with inherited retinal diseases, which will help us better understand the patient‚Äôs perspective of visual impairment.
 Sponsored by Fighting Blindness Canada, we have developed and administered an in-house collaborative National Registry for Inherited Retinal Diseases.
 This is an important tool that allows affected individuals to stay connected with research opportunities, and several of our patients have benefited from retinal gene replacement therapy.
 Dr. Ajoy Vincent develops innovative electrophysiology protocols to better understand our molecular findings. He also leads a research mouse ocular phenotyping unit that also allows us to further explore our novel molecular findings.
 Dr. Elise Heon collaborates with different research groups to identify and validate new treatments for blinding inherited retinal diseases using surrogate cellular and organoid models. Our work combines genetic, molecular, bioinformatics approaches, and the use of animal models.
 Dr. H√©on holds The Henry Brent Chair in Innovative Pediatric Ophthalmology. We train students of all levels, from all over the world, to encourage knowledge translation. It‚Äôs a very exciting time as what we thought was impossible, is becoming possible!

 The relationship between dairy and the west sends a convoluted message. Dairy products often evoke a sense of comfort in food as well as appealing to our reward senses. However the dairy industry and the products being produced are by in large not beneficial to our overall health and there are many leading experts who promote removing it from your diet entirely. The milk you drink today is far removed from idyllic scenes presented by the media, but aside from this the product is also laden with hormones. Often times when this topic is broached the counter argument is that we as humans have used milk in our diet for thousands of years, however this is a one dimensional view of the situation. Dr Ganmaa Davaasambuu p.h.d uses Mongolia as an example in her advanced study published by Harvard. There, in traditional herding societies, cows are milked for human consumption only five months a year and, if pregnant, only in the early stages. Consequently, levels of hormones in the milk are much lower. Modern cultivation of dairy is the issue itself as cows are milked about 300 days a year. In order to meet this demand, the cows are pregnant and they often produce dairy until a much later age than natural, meaning a high increase in hormones with over 10 times more progesterone and oestrogen. On top of large amounts of oestrogen and progesterone being present in the milk, Bovine Growth Hormone is also injected on a weekly basis into dairy cows in some countries to make them grow bigger faster, and produce more milk to sell. International bestselling book The China Study by Dr. T. Colin Campbell is the largest comprehensive study of human nutrition ever conducted. It was launched via a partnership between Cornell University, Oxford University, and the Chinese Academy of Preventative Medicine and in it the relationship between dairy and disease is explored at length. It is shown that Bovine causes the chemical IGF-1 to be released. This has been linked to a whole host of diseases, including breast and prostate cancer, hypertension, diabetes, and gynecomastia. There are many other hormones present in dairy such as casein, which is found to promote cancers at all stages,and VEGF which has a high correlation to disease. If you also take into account the link between acidosis and disease there are quite a few arguments for adopting a dairy free diet. You may wonder why, if dairy is so dangerous, there is not more done to highlight the risks? This could be related to vested interests as the dairy industry represents 12% of Britains GDP. The good news is there are many fantastic resources available to help you on your journey and in my 4 years of being dairy free I have never found it a struggle to travel or eat out at restaurants. For British women leading the revolution I suggest following Deliciously Ella, Natasha Corrett and Amelia Freer.

 Examine the Relationship Between Dairy Consumption and Health
 
 Analyze the information presented on the dairy industry and its products, and then propose a well-supported argument for or against removing dairy from your diet entirely, using at least two specific points from the text to support your position.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 Based on the information presented in the text, I strongly argue that removing dairy from your diet entirely is the best option for maintaining optimal health.",No,"### FEEDBACK: EXAMINATION AND ARGUMENT
 
 ### EXAMINATION
 
 The provided text highlights several points about the dairy industry, including the inhumane treatment of cows, the excessive production of hormones, and the presence of Bovine Growth Hormone. However, it also presents a one-dimensional view of the situation by focusing solely on the negative aspects of dairy consumption.
 
 ### ARGUMENT
 
 Based on the information presented in the text, I propose that removing dairy from your diet entirely is the best option for maintaining optimal health. Firstly, the excessive production of hormones in dairy products, such as progesterone and estrogen, has been linked to various diseases, including breast and prostate cancer, hypertension, diabetes, and gynecomastia. These hormones can have a profound impact on our overall health, and removing dairy from the diet may help mitigate these risks.
 
 Secondly, the presence of casein and VEGF in dairy products has been linked to an increased risk of cancer. Casein is a protein that can promote cancer at all stages, and VEGF has a high correlation to disease. By avoiding dairy products, individuals may be able to reduce their exposure to these substances and minimize their risk of developing these diseases.
 
 ### RECOMMENDATION
 
 In conclusion, based on the information presented in the text, I strongly argue that removing dairy from your diet entirely is the best option for maintaining optimal health. By avoiding dairy products and promoting a balanced diet that includes plant-based sources of protein, calcium, and other essential nutrients, individuals can significantly reduce their risk of developing chronic diseases.
 
 ### ADJUSTMENT
 
 To facilitate learning, I will adapt to different learning styles by using visual aids, such as diagrams and infographics, to illustrate the points made in the text. I will also use real-life examples, such as the vegan nut cheese recipe provided, to demonstrate the feasibility and enjoyment of a dairy-free diet.","### FEEDBACK: Strong Argument, but Consideration of Counterarguments Needed
 
 The proposed argument effectively uses evidence from the text to support the claim that removing dairy from the diet is beneficial for health. However, to strengthen the argument, consider addressing potential counterarguments, such as the importance of dairy in certain cultural or nutritional contexts. Additionally, providing more nuanced analysis of the benefits and drawbacks of dairy consumption, including its potential impact on individual health needs and circumstances, would enhance the argument.
 To improve the argument, consider incorporating more specific examples from the text, such as the comparison between the levels of hormones in milk produced by cows in traditional herding societies versus those raised for human consumption, or the discussion of the potential risks associated with excessive dairy consumption. This would provide more depth and context to the argument, and help to build a more compelling case for or against removing dairy from the diet.",B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 MGS MOC Release No. MOC2-311, 7 May 2002
 Small view (470 KBytes)
 Full-size (965 KBytes)
 This picture, obtained in February 2001, shows streamers of dark sand coming from outcrops of the lower, dark-toned unit. The streamers join a nearby dune field less than a few kilometers (less than a mile) away. Erosion of the lower layered unit liberates sand that was long ago deposited in these layers. The upper unit, by contrast, contains almost no sand. Wind erosion of the lower unit leads to creation of steep scarps as the sand is removed and the upper unit is undermined. The sand moves downwind (in this case, toward the bottom left of the image) and creates dunes.
 The new views of the martian north polar cap obtained in 1999 and 2001 suggest that it may not contain as much water ice as previously believed. Indeed, the amount of ice may be as little as half of what was once thought. The picture shown here is 3 km (1.9 mi) wide and illuminated from the lower left.
 Another picture showing the upper and lower layered sequences of the north polar cap can be seen by clicking here: ""MOC Extended Mission View of North Polar Layers,"" 11 February 2002.

 Based on the provided passage about Mars' geology, describe the transformation process of the lower layered unit of the north polar cap into dunes. How does the upper unit change during this process?
 
 Explain how the lower layered unit is eroded into streamers of dark sand.
 Discuss the role of wind in the creation of dunes and scarps.
 Characterize the change in the upper unit as the lower unit is eroded.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 The lower layered unit of the north polar cap is transformed into dunes through a process where erosion liberates sand that was deposited in these layers. The process begins with the erosion of the lower layered unit which leads to the formation of streamers of dark sand. As the lower unit is eroded, the upper unit is undermined, leading to the creation of steep scarps. Wind plays a crucial role in this process by carrying the sand away from the scarps, depositing it downwind and creating dunes. Meanwhile, the upper unit undergoes a change as it is undermined and scarps are formed, but it remains largely intact with little to no sand.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: 
 Your description of the transformation process of the lower layered unit of the north polar cap into dunes is mostly accurate. You correctly explained how the lower layered unit is eroded into streamers of dark sand and how wind contributes to the creation of dunes and scarps.
 
 You did not fully explain the role of wind in the creation of dunes and scarps. To improve, you could mention that wind carries the sand away from the scarps, depositing it downwind and creating dunes.
 Your description of the change in the upper unit is somewhat incomplete. You could elaborate on how the upper unit remains largely intact with little to no sand, but also mention that it undergoes a change as it is undermined and scarps are formed.","### FEEDBACK: ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE
 
 **Assignment Response:** 
 The transformation process of the lower layered unit of the north polar cap into dunes is a complex and dynamic process. 
 
 **1. Erosion of the Lower Layered Unit:** The erosion of the lower layered unit liberates sand that was deposited in these layers, leading to the formation of streamers of dark sand. This process is facilitated by wind erosion, which carries the sand away from the scarps and deposits it downwind, creating dunes.
 
 **2. Formation of Steep Scarps:** As the lower unit is eroded, the upper unit is undermined, resulting in the formation of steep scarps. This process is driven by wind erosion, which erodes the upper unit and creates a gap, allowing the sand to flow downwind and form dunes.
 
 **3. Change in the Upper Unit:** The upper unit remains largely intact with little to no sand, as it is undermined and scarps are formed. This indicates that the upper unit undergoes a change, but it does not experience significant erosion or sand loss.
 
 **Feedback:**
 
 * The passage provides a clear and concise description of the transformation process of the lower layered unit into dunes.
 * The role of wind in the creation of dunes and scarps is effectively explained, highlighting the importance of wind erosion in this process.
 * The characterization of the change in the upper unit as it is undermined and scarps are formed is accurate, demonstrating an understanding of the dynamic nature of the Martian geology.
 * The response is well-structured, clear, and easy to follow, making it an effective example of providing constructive feedback.
 
 **Recommendations for Improvement:**
 
 * Consider adding more specific details about the Martian geology and the processes involved in the transformation of the lower layered unit into dunes.
 * Provide more context about the role of wind erosion in the creation of dunes and scarps, and how it interacts with the Martian environment.
 * Consider adding more depth to the characterization of the change in the upper unit, exploring the implications of this change for the Martian geology and the potential for future research.",A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 The ‚Äúpresidi‚Äù translates as ‚Äúgarrisons‚Äù (from the French word, ‚Äúto equip‚Äù), as protectors of traditional food production practices
 Monday, March 23, 2009
 The ‚Äúpresidi‚Äù translates as ‚Äúgarrisons‚Äù (from the French word, ‚Äúto equip‚Äù), as protectors of traditional food production practices
 This past year, I have had rewarding opportunities to observe traditional food cultures in varied regions of the world. These are:
 Athabascan Indian in the interior of Alaska (the traditional Tanana Chiefs Conference tribal lands) in July, 2008 (for more, read below);
 Swahili coastal tribes in the area of Munje village (population about 300), near Msambweni, close to the Tanzania border in December, 2008-January, 2009 (for more, read below); and,Laikipia region of Kenya (January, 2009), a German canton of Switzerland (March, 2009), and the Piemonte-Toscana region of northern/central Italy (images only, February-March, 2009).
 In Fort Yukon, Alaska, salmon is a mainstay of the diet. Yet, among the Athabascan Indians, threats to subsistence foods and stresses on household economics abound. In particular, high prices for external energy sources (as of July, 2008, almost $8 for a gallon of gasoline and $6.50 for a gallon of diesel, which is essential for home heating), as well as low Chinook salmon runs for information click here, and moose numbers.
 Additional resource management issues pose threats to sustaining village life ‚Äì for example, stream bank erosion along the Yukon River, as well as uneven management in the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge. People are worried about ever-rising prices for fuels and store-bought staples, and fewer and fewer sources of wage income. The result? Villagers are moving out from outlying areas into ‚Äúhub‚Äù communities like Fort Yukon -- or another example, Bethel in Southwest Alaska ‚Äì even when offered additional subsidies, such as for home heating. But, in reality, ‚Äúhubs‚Äù often offer neither much employment nor relief from high prices.
 In Munje village in Kenya, the Digo, a Bantu-speaking, mostly Islamic tribe in the southern coastal area of Kenya, enjoy the possibilities of a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and fish/oils.
 Breakfast in the village typically consists of mandazi (a fried bread similar to a doughnut), and tea with sugar. Lunch and dinner is typically ugali and samaki (fish), maybe with some dried cassava or chickpeas.
 On individual shambas (small farms), tomatoes, cassava, maize, cowpeas, bananas, mangos, and coconut are typically grown. Ugali is consumed every day, as are cassava, beans, oil, fish -- and rice, coconut, and chicken, depending on availability.
 Even with their own crops, villagers today want very much to enter the market economy and will sell products from their shambas to buy staples and the flour needed to make mandazis, which they in turn sell. Sales of mandazis (and mango and coconut, to a lesser extent) bring in some cash for villagers.
 A treasured food is, in fact, the coconut. This set of pictures show how coconut is used in the village. True, coconut oil now is reserved only for frying mandazi. But it also is used as a hair conditioner, and the coconut meat is eaten between meals. I noted also that dental hygiene and health were good in the village. Perhaps the coconut and fish oils influence this (as per the work of Dr. Weston A. Price).
 Photos L-R: Using a traditional conical basket (kikatu), coconut milk is pressed from the grated meat; Straining coconut milk from the grated meat, which is then heated to make oil; Common breakfast food (and the main source of cash income), the mandazi, is still cooked in coconut oil

 Despite maize in the fields, it is widely known that farmers are hoarding stocks in many districts. Farmers are refusing the NCPB/government price of Sh1,950 per 90-kg bag. They are waiting to be offered at least the same amount of money as that which was being assigned to imports (Bii, 2009b). ‚ÄúThe country will continue to experience food shortages unless the Government addresses the high cost of farm inputs to motivate farmers to increase production,‚Äù said Mr. Jonathan Bii of Uasin Gish (Bartoo & Lucheli, 2009; Bii, 2009a, 2009b; Bungee, 2009).
 Pride and politics, racism and corruption are to blame for food deficits (Kihara & Marete, 2009; KNA, 2009; Muluka, 2009; Siele, 2009). Clearly, what are needed in Kenya are food system planning, disaster management planning, and protection and development of agricultural and rural economies.

 Today I went to a lunch time discussion of sustainability. This concept promoted development with an equitable eye to the triple bottom line - financial, social, and ecological costs. We discussed the how it seemed relatively easier to discuss the connections between financial and ecological costs, than between social costs and other costs. Sustainable development often comes down to ""green"" designs that consider environmental impacts or critiques of the capitalist model of financing.
 As I thought about sustainable development, or sustainable community management if you are a bit queasy with the feasibility of continuous expansion, I considered its corollaries in the field of disaster risk reduction. It struck me again that it is somewhat easier to focus on some components of the triple bottom line in relation to disasters.
 The vulnerability approach to disasters has rightly brought into focus the fact that not all people are equally exposed to or impacted by disasters. Rather, it is often the poor or socially marginalized most at risk and least able to recover. This approach certainly brings into focus the social aspects of disasters.
 The disaster trap theory, likewise, brings into focus the financial bottom line. This perspective is most often discussed in international development and disaster reduction circles. It argues that disasters destroy development gains and cause communities to de-develop unless both disaster reduction and development occur in tandem. Building a cheaper, non-earthquake resistant school in an earthquake zone, may make short-term financial sense. However,over the long term, this approach is likely to result in loss of physical infrastructure, human life, and learning opportunities when an earthquake does occur.
 What seems least developed to me, though I would enjoy being rebutted, is the ecological bottom line of disasters. Perhaps it is an oxymoron to discuss the ecological costs of disasters, given that many disasters are triggered natural ecological processes like cyclones, forest fires, and floods. It might also be an oxymoron simply because a natural hazard disaster is really looking at an ecological event from an almost exclusively human perspective. Its not a disaster if it doesn't destroy human lives and human infrastructure. But, the lunch-time discussion made me wonder if there wasn't something of an ecological bottom line to disasters in there somewhere. Perhaps it is in the difference between an ecological process heavily or lightly impacted by human ecological modification. Is a forest fire in a heavily managed forest different from that in an unmanaged forest? Certainly logging can heighten the impacts of heavy rains by inducing landslides, resulting in a landscape heavily rather than lightly impacted by the rains. Similar processes might also be true in the case of heavily managed floodplains. Flooding is concentrated and increased in areas outside of levee systems. What does that mean for the ecology of these locations? Does a marsh manage just as well in low as high flooding? My guess would be no.
 And of course, there is the big, looming disaster of climate change. This is a human-induced change that may prove quite disasterous to many an ecological system, everything from our pine forests here, to arctic wildlife, and tropical coral reefs.
 Perhaps, we disaster researchers, need to also consider a triple bottom line when making arguments for the benefits of disaster risk reduction.

 This past week the Northwest experienced a severe barrage of weather systems back to back. Everyone seemed to be affected. Folks were re-routed on detours, got soaked, slipped on ice, or had to spend money to stay a little warmer. In Whatcom and Skagit Counties, there are hundreds to thousands of people currently in the process of recovering and cleaning-up after the floods. These people live in the rural areas throughout the county, with fewer people knowing about their devastation and having greater vulnerability to flood hazards.
 Luckily, there are local agencies and non-profits who are ready at a moment‚Äôs call to help anyone in need. The primary organization that came to the aid of the flood victims was the American Red Cross.
 The last week I began interning and volunteering with one of these non-profits, the Mt. Baker American Red Cross (ARC) Chapter. While I am still in the process of getting screened and officially trained, I received first-hand experience and saw how important this organization is to the community.
 With the flood waters rising throughout the week, people were flooded out of their homes and rescued from the overflowing rivers and creeks. As the needs for help increased, hundreds of ARC volunteers were called to service. Throughout the floods there have been several shelters opened to accommodate the needs of these flood victims. On Saturday I was asked to help staff one of these shelters overnight in Ferndale.
 While I talked with parents and children, I became more aware of the stark reality of how these people have to recover from having all their possessions covered in sewage and mud and damaged by flood waters. In the meantime, these flood victims have all their privacy exposed to others in a public shelter, while they work to find stability in the middle of all the traumas of the events. As I sat talking and playing with the children, another thought struck me. Children are young and resilient, but it must be very difficult when they connect with a volunteer and then lose that connection soon after. Sharing a shelter with the folks over the weekend showed a higher degree of reality and humanity to the situation than the news coverage ever could.
 I posted this bit about my volunteer experience because it made me realize something about my education and degree track in disaster reduction and emergency planning. We look at ways to create a more sustainable community, and we need to remember that community service is an important part of creating this ideal. Underlying sustainable development is the triple bottom line (social, economy, and environment). Volunteers and non-profits are a major part of this social line of sustainability. Organizations like the American Red Cross only exist because of volunteers. So embrace President-elect Obama‚Äôs call for a culture of civil service this coming week and make a commitment to the organization of your choice with your actions or even your pocketbook. Know that sustainable development cannot exist with out social responsibility.

 Its been two days now that schools have been closed in Whatcom County, not for snow, but for rain and flooding. This unusual event coincides with record flooding throughout Western Washington, just a year after record flooding closed I5 for three days and Lewis County businesses experienced what they then called an unprecedented 500 year flood. I guess not.
 There are many strange things about flood risk notation, and this idea that a 500 year flood often trips people up. They often believe a flood of that size will happen only once in 500 years. On a probabilistic level, this is inaccurate. A 500 year flood simply has a .2% probability of happening each year. A more useful analogy might be to tell people they are rolling a 500 sided die every year and hoping that it doesn‚Äôt come up with a 1. Next year they‚Äôll be forced to roll again.
 But, this focus on misunderstandings of probability often hides an even larger societal misunderstanding . Flood risk changes when we change the environment in which it occurs. If a flood map tells you that you are not in the flood plain, better check the date of the map. Most maps are utterly out of date and many vastly underestimate present flood risk. There are several reasons this happens. Urban development, especially development with a lot of parking lots and buildings that don‚Äôt let water seep into the ground, will cause rainwater to move quickly into rivers rather than seep into the ground and slowly release. Developers might complain that they are required to create runoff catchment wetlands when they do build. They do, but these requirements may very well be based upon outdated data on flood risk. Thus, each new development never fully compensates for its runoff, a small problem for each site but a mammoth problem when compounded downstream.
 Deforesting can have the same effect, with the added potential for house-crushing and river-clogging mudslides. Timber harvesting is certainly an important industry in our neck of the woods. Not only is commercial logging an important source of jobs for many rural and small towns, logging on state Department of Natural Resource land is the major source of funding for K-12 education. Yet, commercial logging, like other industries, suffers from a problem of cost externalization. When massive mudslides occurred during last year‚Äôs storm, Weyerhaeuser complained that it wasn‚Äôt it‚Äôs logging practices, but the fact that it was an unprecedented, out of the blue, 500 year storm that caused it. While it is doubtful the slides would have occurred uncut land, that isn‚Äôt the only fallacy. When the slide did occur, the costs of repairing roads, treatment plants, and bridges went to the county and often was passed on to the nation‚Äôs tax payers through state and federal recovery grants. Thus, what should have been paid by Weyerhaeuser, 500 year probability or not, was paid by someone else.
 Finally, there is local government. Various folks within local governments set regulations for zoning, deciding what will be built and where. Here is the real crux of the problem. Local government also gets an increase in revenue in the form of property, sales, and business income taxes. Suppress the updating of flood plain maps, and you get a short term profit and often, a steady supply of happy voters. You might think these local governments will have to pay when the next big flood comes, but often that can be avoided. Certainly, they must comply with federal regulations on flood plain management to be part of the National Flood Insurance program, but that plan has significant leeway and little monitoring. Like the commercial logging, disaster-stricken local governments can often push the recovery costs off to individual homeowners through the FEMA homeowner‚Äôs assistance program, and off to state and federal agencies by receiving disaster recovery and community development grants and loans. Certainly, some communities are so regularly devastated, and are so few resources, that disasters simply knock them down before they can given stand up again. But others have found loopholes and can profit by continuing to use old food maps and failing to aggressively control flood plain development.
 What is it going to take to really change this system and make it unprofitable to profit from bad land use management?

In March of 1989 six million people in eastern Canada lost their electrical power for nine hours because of really big space weather storm.
 Our electrical systems are designed to use alternating current (AC) electricity. Space weather disturbances can cause large flows of direct current (DC) electricity in power transmission wires. Electrical systems use very high voltage electricity to transmit power over long distances from power plants to peoples' homes and to businesses. However, high voltage electricity is dangerous, so the power is converted to lower voltage before it is delivered to homes and other users. Transformers are devices that convert high voltage electricity to lower voltage electricity.
 Transformers work fine with AC electricity, but can be damaged or destroyed if too much DC electricity flows into them. That's what can happen during big space weather storms. If many transformers fail at once, the whole electrical system over a large area can go down. That's how space weather can cause a blackout.

 Space Weather Effects on Electrical Power Systems
 
 Imagine a space weather storm is forecasted to affect your area. Write a short letter to your family explaining the potential risks to the electrical power system and what precautions you can take to prepare.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 Dear Family,
 
 A space weather storm is forecasted to affect our area soon. You might have already seen some aurora (Northern or Southern Lights) in the sky, which is a sign of the electricity flowing in our atmosphere. This storm can cause problems with our electrical power system and might even lead to a blackout. That means we might not have electricity for a while.
 
 This could be a problem for some of the electrical things in our house like the refrigerator and the lights. To prepare for this, let's make sure to have some food ready that does not need to be refrigerated and have some flashlights and batteries ready in case the power goes out.
 
 It's also a good idea to charge our phones and other portable electronics in case we lose power. Let's also make sure to unplug some of our electronics to protect them from any electrical surges that might happen during the storm. That way we can be ready and stay safe until the power comes back on.

 We all know, the muscle mass diminish as we age, which leads to progressive loss in our muscle strength. But many of us might not know that the power dwindles even more rapidly. Whereas strength is an important factor, but your capacity to produce power is more critical to your ability to carry on the activities of everyday living.
 Read on to learn what Power Training is? How to do Power-Training with examples, tips & VIDEOS, especially for beginners, older adults & seniors.
 To understand the difference between strength & power, just consider this everyday-living example: A senior citizen who has sufficient strength can in all likely hood cross an extremely busy intersection with relative ease. In comparison, a senior citizen who is able to produce more power can cross the same intersection faster before the light changes.
 Effect Of Power & Strength Training On Every Day Physical Functions
 A study published in the Journal of Gerontology, Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences in 2003 analyzed the effects of a sixteen-week exercise program on the physical activities. In this study 39 subjects between the ages of 65 & 90 participated. They were randomly divided in three groups.
 (ii) Control Group: Participants were asked to continue their usual activity with no intervention.
 (ii) Second Group: Participants were performed a sixteen-week strength-training routine of traditional resistance exercises 3 days per week.
 (iii) Third group performed were instructed to perform eight weeks of traditional strength training followed by 8 weeks of power training.
 It was found at the end of the sixteen weeks, the power-training group exhibited greater improvements in physical function. (Source).
 Power Training For Senior Citizens & Older Adults
 Most people, including senior citizens & older adults, can benefit from power training. You can include power-training exercises into your workout routine, provided you are already doing exercises and have a good foundation of strength. Moreover, if you have joint pain, instability or joint inflammation then you should not do power training.
 You can do power training in various ways, but performing the usual resistance exercises is a great way to begin. Here are some good tips to start including power training into senior fitness workout programs:
 (i) Choose both upper- and lower-body types of exercises that you are already performing well.
 (ii) Practice to perform the exercise quickly during the concentric phase & slowly, in a controlled manner during the eccentric phase.
 (iii) Select multi-joint exercises that mimic activities of daily living.
 Examples Of Power Exercises
 Upper Body: Pushups
 Move into the downward phase slowly in a controlled manner (e.g., for 3 counts). Next, do the upward phase rapidly (e.g., 1 count). Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
 Note: The beginners & seniors can watch this video to learn proper technique of doing pushups. Note: For power do the upward movement quickly & downward movement slowly.
 Lower Body: Body-weight Squat
 Move into the downward phase slowly in a controlled manner (e.g., for 3 counts). Next, stand up rapidly (e.g., 1 count). Perform the desired number of repetitions.
 Note: The beginners & seniors can watch this video to learn proper technique of doing squats. Note: For power do the upward movement quickly & downward movement slowly.
 Important: Power Training Tips
 (i) Like traditional strength training, power training can be done on 2 to 3 nonconsecutive days in a week. Keep the exercise intensity somewhere between 20-80% of your 1-RM. Do 1 to 3 sets of six to 12 repetitions. Be sure to start conservatively and progressively increase intensity, reps & sets as you gain power & strength.
 (ii) Select some strength exercise, which you can do comfortably. Perform it‚Äôs concentric & eccentric contractions in the manner as stated in the above two examples to increase your functional power. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Create a short skit illustrating the difference between muscle strength and power in the context of crossing a busy intersection, inspired by the example in the article.
 
 Write a script that showcases one character successfully crossing the intersection with sufficient strength, but struggling to do so quickly, while another character crosses the intersection rapidly, highlighting the importance of power.
 Incorporate props or visual elements to differentiate between the two characters' approaches, such as a timer or a 'walk/don't walk' signal.
 Ensure the skit is 2-3 minutes long and includes a clear narrative demonstrating the distinction between strength and power in everyday activities.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 I would create a short skit where two characters, Alex and Ben, are standing at a busy intersection, waiting for the light to change. When the light turns green, Alex, who has sufficient strength, starts crossing the intersection at a moderate pace. However, Ben, who has more power, quickly sprints across the intersection, beating the changing light.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: 
 The skit concept is a good start, but it needs refinement to effectively convey the difference between muscle strength and power.
 
 To address the first error, consider adding a transition or a distinct scene to separate Alex's approach from Ben's, making it clear that Alex is using strength to cross the intersection, while Ben is using power to quickly and efficiently cross.
 For the second error, think about incorporating visual elements that illustrate the difference between strength and power, such as a 'power meter' that Ben uses to gauge his speed and a'strength gauge' that Alex uses to track his progress. This will help to reinforce the concept and make the skit more engaging.
 To improve the script, consider adding more context or dialogue to explain the importance of power in everyday activities, such as crossing a busy intersection. This will help to make the skit more relatable and impactful.
 Finally, to address the third error, consider adding a clear conclusion or a final scene to summarize the key points. This could involve Ben reflecting on the importance of power and Alex sharing their approach to strength training.","### FEEDBACK: SKIT SCRIPT

"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
 LOS ANGELES ‚Äî For 75 years, scientists have documented a curious fact: If rats and mice eat 30 percent to 40 percent fewer calories than usual, they live 15 percent to 40 percent longer than is typical for their species. The observation has offered humans hope that our own maximum lifespan could one day be extended, permitting people to live well past their 100th birthday.
 A new study in monkeys pours cold water on that notion ‚Äî while at the same time offering some heartening health news.
 Among a colony of rhesus monkeys tracked for more than 20 years, animals whose calories were restricted to 30 percent below normal lived no longer on average than monkeys whose eating was unrestricted, scientists found. But the diet did offer clear benefits, notably in warding off cancer.
 It appears that ‚Äúwe are seeing a separation between what we call ‚Äòhealthspan‚Äô from ‚Äòlifespan‚Äô ‚Äî they are not hand in hand,‚Äù said Rafael de Cabo, an experimental gerontologist at the National Institute on Aging in Baltimore and senior author of the new study.
 The report, published online Wednesday by the journal Nature, suggests that what has proven true for rodents and various other animals may not hold true for primates ‚Äî humans included ‚Äî at least under the conditions that were studied. It will likely disappoint those hundreds of people in the U.S. who practice a strict regimen of calorie restriction in hopes of postponing their appointment with the Grim Reaper.
 But the findings also have some researchers scratching their heads. The results are quite different from a 2009 report of monkeys in a colony in Wisconsin that found a clear survival edge from age-related diseases like diabetes, cancer and heart disease in calorie-restricted animals. That study also saw a trend toward longer life for monkeys on the diet when all causes of death were considered.
 Figuring out whether differences in diet, the animals‚Äô genetic makeup or something else caused the results to diverge could offer important clues to the way that calorie restriction ‚Äî and aging ‚Äî work, de Cabo said.
 The new study tracked 121 male and female monkeys at the National Institutes of Health‚Äôs animal center in Maryland starting in 1987. One group of 35 animals ‚Äî the ‚Äúold onset‚Äù group ‚Äî were 16 to 23 years old when the study began. (Rhesus monkeys mature around the age of 4 or 5 and live to 27, on average, in captivity). The rest were in a group that included juvenile and adolescent monkeys as well as younger adults up to the age of 14.
 All the monkeys received the same food diet, but the control animals could eat as much as they wanted during daylight hours. The rest were limited to only 70 percent of what they ate before the experiment began.
 In the older group, there was no overall difference in ages of death between calorie-restricted and free-eating animals. That was true when all causes of death were considered together as well as when deaths from age-related illnesses were calculated separately, the authors found.
 Longevity under both conditions was above the norm, however. And four of the older animals in the calorie-restricted group and one from the control group have broken rhesus monkey longevity records by living beyond 40 years.
 That fact especially intrigues gerontologist Rick Weindruch of the University of Wisconsin in Madison, author of the earlier monkey study.
 ‚ÄúTo me this is really important ‚Äî that five animals either reached or exceeded what has been thought to be the maximum lifespan of the species,‚Äù Weindruch said.
 Among the younger animals, the scientists didn‚Äôt find any survival edge for dieting animals either. But they did find reduced rates of diabetes and stark differences in the cancer rates.
 So far, no monkey in the calorie-restricted group has been diagnosed with cancer, de Cabo said, whereas six cases have occurred in the controls and are believed to have been the cause of death of five of them. That is in line with rodent studies, which have also found that calorie restriction seems to ward off cancer.
 There were other differences, too. Calorie-restricted monkeys weighed less and looked younger than the animals that ate freely. They also appeared ‚Äúyounger‚Äù in some metabolic respects, with lower blood levels of triglycerides and glucose in the old group and lower cholesterol levels in males of both age classes.
 The fact that diseases of old age can be warded off even if lifespan isn‚Äôt necessarily extended suggests ‚Äúthat health and longevity are not the same thing,‚Äù said Steven N. Austad, a biogerontologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio who wrote a commentary accompanying the report.
 This could be considered encouraging, he added: ‚ÄúIn the ideal scenario, we‚Äôd stay healthy to a relatively decent age and then we‚Äôd suddenly fall over at the appropriate time. That would be a good thing. What we don‚Äôt want is people living longer and longer in worse and worse health.‚Äù
 Scientists aren‚Äôt sure how to explain why the new study produced different results than the Wisconsin study, in which only 13 percent of the calorie-restricted monkeys died due to some age-related disease compared with 37 percent of the control monkeys.
 But they have some ideas. Chief among them: The food served was very different, even though the overall amounts of protein, carbohydrates and fats were similar in both studies.
 The Wisconsin diet consisted of purified ingredients mixed together and was high in sugar, perhaps explaining why so many of the free-feeding monkeys in that study developed diabetes. The Maryland monkeys ate a diet made from natural ingredients that contains more plant micronutrients and omega-3 fatty acids, among other items.
 As a result, all of the monkeys in the new study may have been healthier overall, regardless of whether they were calorie-restricted or not.
 Though the final word on whether calorie restriction extends lifespan is not in ‚Äî nearly 50 percent of the younger monkeys are still alive ‚Äî the authors wrote that they are unlikely to find a survival edge when all is said and done. But it is always possible they will, de Cabo said, especially if the cancer difference continues to mount.
 Even if the strategy turns out not to be the elixir of youth, that wouldn‚Äôt devastate 54-year-old St. Louis resident Joe Cordell, an avid practitioner of calorie restriction for the last 10 years.
 ‚ÄúI would like to live to the outer limits of what human beings normally live,‚Äù said the 5-foot-9, 129-pound lawyer who eats berries, apple peel and walnuts for breakfast and favors giant salads for dinner.
 But, he added, ‚ÄúI would be delighted to take 90 to 95 years without cancer, without heart disease, without diabetes or other chronic illnesses. To me, that would have warranted this.‚Äù

 The response does not provide a clear conclusion or final thought on the importance of understanding the distinction between 'healthspan' and 'lifespan'. To improve, summarize the main points and reiterate the significance of this distinction in the context of human health and aging.","### FEEDBACK: EVALUATION OF DISTINCTION BETWEEN 'HEALTHSPAN' AND 'LIFESPAN'
 
 **Definition of 'Healthspan':**
 
 In the context of the study, 'healthspan' refers to the period of a person's life when they are free from age-related diseases and health issues, without any limitations or constraints. The term is derived from the Latin words 'health' and'span,' indicating a span of time or period during which an individual remains healthy and free from disease.
 
 **Definition of 'Lifespan':**
 
 On the other hand, 'lifespan' is the total number of years a person is expected to live, taking into account various factors such as genetics, lifestyle, and environmental influences. In the study, 'lifespan' refers to the maximum expected lifespan of an individual, which may be influenced by various factors such as genetics, nutrition, and lifestyle.
 
 **Discussion:**
 
 The distinction between 'healthspan' and 'lifespan' is crucial in understanding the concept of aging and human health. The study's findings suggest that the relationship between caloric restriction and healthspan versus lifespan is complex and may not be straightforward. While the study found that calorie-restricted monkeys lived longer than their unrestricted counterparts, the difference in lifespan was not significant, and the cancer rate was lower in the calorie-restricted group.
 
 The implications of this distinction are far-reaching. If caloric restriction can extend healthspan, it may have significant implications for our understanding of aging and the development of new treatments for age-related diseases. However, if caloric restriction does not extend lifespan, it may not be a viable strategy for preventing or delaying aging.
 
 **Real-world applications:**
 
 The study's findings have significant implications for real-world applications. For example, if caloric restriction can extend healthspan, it may encourage people to adopt a healthier lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, to maintain optimal health and well-being. However, if caloric restriction does not extend lifespan, it may not be a viable strategy for preventing or delaying aging.
 
 **Perspectives of researchers, practitioners, and the general public:**
 
 The study's findings may have significant implications for researchers, practitioners of calorie restriction, and the general public. For instance, the study's findings may encourage people to adopt a healthier lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, to maintain optimal health and well-being. On the other hand, the study's findings may also highlight the limitations of caloric restriction as a strategy for preventing or delaying aging.
 
 In conclusion, the distinction between 'healthspan' and 'lifespan' is crucial in understanding the concept of aging and human health. The study's findings suggest that caloric restriction may extend healthspan, but may not extend lifespan. This distinction has significant implications for real-world applications, including the development of new treatments for age-related diseases and the encouragement of healthy lifestyles.
 
 **Assessment of relevance:**
 
 The study's findings are highly relevant to real-world applications, including the development of new treatments for age-related diseases and the encouragement of healthy lifestyles. The study's findings may also have significant implications for policymakers, who may consider caloric restriction as a strategy for promoting public health.
 
 **Recommendations:**
 
 Based on the study's findings, I recommend that policymakers consider the following:
 
 1. Caloric restriction may be a viable strategy for promoting public health, particularly for individuals at high risk of age-related diseases.
 2. The study's findings highlight the importance of considering the limitations of caloric restriction as a strategy for preventing or delaying aging.
 3. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between caloric restriction and healthspan versus lifespan.
 
 **Conclusion:**
 
 In conclusion, the study's findings highlight the complexity of the relationship between caloric restriction and healthspan versus lifespan. While caloric restriction may extend healthspan, it may not extend lifespan. This distinction has significant implications for real-world applications, including the development of new treatments for age-related diseases and the encouragement of healthy lifestyles.",A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Celebrating Memorial Day
 Memorial Day Weekend marks the unofficial start of Summer, a weekend where families travel, have that first picnic, go out to the lake, or head to the stores to take advantage of the latest sales. While the weekend may afford us a wonderful opportunity to gather with family and friends, we must remember what this holiday is really about -- thinking of and honoring those who sacrificed their lives for their country.
 An official Federal holiday for the last three decades, the origins of Memorial Day go back to the years just following the Civil War. In the spring of 1866 localities across the nation held tributes to those who lost their lives in the war. In 1868, Maj. Gen. John A. Logan -- the head of the Grand Army of the Republic, an organization of Union veterans -- established Decoration Day to give people across the nation an opportunity to decorate the graves of war veterans. After World War I, the day was expanded to honor those who have died in all American Wars, not just the Civil War and in 1971, Memorial Day was declared a national holiday by an act of Congress.
 With American troops in Iraq and other stations of the world fighting for our nation and for our freedom, it is important that we reflect on the meaning of Memorial Day and remember the efforts and sacrifices of all of our veterans and military personnel -- past and present.
 As Memorial Day approaches, I am looking forward to the creation of the National Purple Heart Hall of Honor, to be located in the Town of New Windsor. The Hall will recognize the more than two million brave American men and women who have been killed or wounded in combat. This state-of-the-art 21st century facility will preserve the stories of ordinary men and women and the extraordinary sacrifices they made for this nation. During this Memorial Day season I urge you to join our campaign for the Purple Heart Hall of Honor. Call my Albany or New Windsor office for more information about what you can do: (518) 455-2770; (845) 567-1270.
 New York State is home to about 1.2 million veterans. There have been approximately 90,000 Purple Heart recipients from New York. It is both our responsibility and privilege to give appropriate recognition to those veterans who served our country and to honor those who bravely lost their lives. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

 Additionally, while your essay demonstrates a good understanding of the historical context and the expanded scope of Memorial Day, it could benefit from a more nuanced discussion of its cultural significance. Consider exploring how the holiday is observed in different parts of the country, what symbols and traditions are associated with it, and how it is perceived by different demographics.
 Finally, be mindful of the essay's length and focus. While you have provided a thorough analysis, some sections could be condensed or removed to maintain a clear and concise argument.","### FEEDBACK: Evaluating the Contemporary Relevance of Memorial Day
 
 As we reflect on the significance of Memorial Day, it is essential to examine its evolution over time. The origins of this holiday, as highlighted in the provided text, reveal a gradual shift in its purpose from honoring Civil War veterans to recognizing those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in all American conflicts.
 
 The expansion of Decoration Day to honor those who died in all American wars, including World War I and more recent engagements, has profoundly impacted the way Americans observe this holiday. This extension has led to a broader understanding of the holiday's purpose, moving beyond its origins as a tribute to Civil War veterans.
 
 In recent years, the inclusion of World War I and other conflicts has allowed Americans to acknowledge the sacrifices of those who have served in all wars. This expanded scope has enabled us to appreciate the diversity of experiences and perspectives that have shaped the nation's history.
 
 Moreover, the recognition of all American conflicts has underscored the importance of the military's role in protecting and defending the nation. This shift in focus has also led to a greater appreciation for the bravery and selflessness of those who have served in various roles, including those who have lost their lives in combat.
 
 However, it is essential to acknowledge that this expanded scope has also led to a potential erosion of the original purpose of the holiday. Some argue that the focus on all American conflicts has overshadowed the significance of honoring Civil War veterans, who are often remembered as a symbol of patriotism and sacrifice.
 
 To better understand the contemporary relevance of Memorial Day, it is crucial to consider the following:
 
 1. **Historical context**: The shift in focus from honoring Civil War veterans to recognizing those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in all American conflicts highlights the changing nature of American society.
 2. **Diversity of experiences**: The inclusion of World War I and other conflicts has allowed Americans to appreciate the diversity of experiences and perspectives that have shaped the nation's history.
 3. **Broader understanding**: The recognition of all American conflicts has enabled Americans to appreciate the importance of the military's role in protecting and defending the nation.
 
 To further emphasize the significance of Memorial Day, we should consider the following:
 
 1. **Community engagement**: Organizing community events, such as parades and ceremonies, can help raise awareness about the holiday and its purpose.
 2. **Education and awareness**: Providing educational resources and promoting awareness about the military's role in protecting and defending the nation can help foster a deeper understanding of the holiday's significance.
 3. **Inclusive approach**: Encouraging a diverse range of perspectives and experiences can help ensure that the holiday remains relevant and meaningful to all Americans.
 
 In conclusion, the contemporary relevance of Memorial Day is a complex and multifaceted issue. While the holiday's expanded scope has led to a broader understanding of its purpose, it is essential to acknowledge the potential erosion of the original purpose. By considering the historical context, diversity of experiences, and broader understanding of the holiday, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and meaningful celebration of this important American tradition.",A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) wants to study the distribution of the brightness of a newly discovered population of stars.
 
 Create a scatter plot to represent the brightness of the stars versus their distance from Earth, using the following data set (distance in light years, brightness in magnitude): (10, 2), (20, 4), (15, 3), (30, 5), (25, 6), (18, 3.5), (12, 2.5), (22, 4.5).
 What information can you infer from the scatter plot about the relationship between the brightness of the stars and their distance from Earth?
 Propose three potential explanations for any observed patterns or correlations in the data.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 From analyzing the created scatter plot, a positive linear relationship can be inferred between the brightness of the stars and their distance from Earth.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: 
 Great effort in analyzing the scatter plot and inferring a relationship between the brightness of the stars and their distance from Earth.
 
 To strengthen your analysis, consider adding a visual representation of the scatter plot, such as a graph or a table with the data points, to help illustrate the relationship between the brightness of the stars and their distance from Earth.
 When discussing potential explanations, be sure to consider alternative explanations for any observed patterns or correlations in the data, such as the effects of dust, gas, or other celestial objects on the brightness of the stars.","### FEEDBACK: SCATTER PLOT ANALYSIS
 
 ### INFERENCE FROM THE SCATTER PLOT
 
 From the scatter plot, it appears that the brightness of the stars increases as their distance from Earth increases. This suggests a positive linear relationship between the two variables. The closer the stars are to Earth, the brighter they appear.
 
 ### POTENTIAL EXPLANATIONS FOR THE OBSERVED PATTERNS OR CORRECTIONS
 
 1. **Gravitational Attraction**: The observed relationship could be due to the gravitational attraction between the stars and Earth. As the stars are farther away from Earth, they experience less gravitational pull, resulting in a brighter appearance.
 
 2. **Atmospheric Effects**: The brightness of the stars may be affected by the Earth's atmosphere. As the stars are closer to Earth, they are less affected by atmospheric scattering, leading to a brighter appearance.
 
 3. **Distance-Dependent Stellar Mass**: The observed relationship could be due to the fact that the brightness of the stars increases with their distance from Earth, but only up to a certain point. At greater distances, the stars' mass decreases, resulting in a lower brightness.",A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 The Commonwealth Government has announced the amounts of assistance that it will be paying to power staions to help them cope with the carbon price legislation.
 Australia‚Äôs dirtiest coal-fired power station are the brown coal stations in the La Trobe Valley ‚Äì Hazelwood, Yallourn and Loy Yang A and B. They emit an estimated total of 41.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. This means that, at the legislated rate of $23 per tonne of emmissions, they will have to pay a total of $963.7 million in the next financial year.
 The amounts of assistance to these power stations will be:
 - Hazelwood: $265,887,649.47
 - Yallourn: $257,498,933.37
 - Loy Yang A: $240,116,761.67
 - Loy Yang B: $116,904,439.63
 which adds up to $880,407,784.14. The power stations will get the money in June but pay for their carbon pollution progressively, starting from July ‚Äì allowing them to invest the cash and make up the slight shortfall in the cash amount.
 While this whole process may seem ridulicous, the Opposition claim that pricing carbon pollution will lead to an immediate increase in electricity prices seems even more ridiculous. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Calculating the Shortfall of Assistance for Power Stations
 
 Read the given article about the assistance amounts for power stations in the La Trobe Valley to cope with the carbon price legislation.
 Use the information provided in the article to calculate the shortfall in the assistance amount for the power stations after they pay for their carbon pollution in the next financial year. Explain your calculation process in detail.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 To calculate the shortfall, we first need to determine the total amount of assistance given to the power stations and the total amount they will pay for carbon pollution in the next financial year. According to the article, the power stations will emit an estimated total of 41.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. At the legislated rate of $23 per tonne of emissions, they will have to pay a total of $963,700,000 in the next financial year. The total amount of assistance is $880,407,784.14.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: 
 The student has provided a good start to the calculation, but there are a couple of areas that need improvement.
 
 The student incorrectly stated the total amount of assistance given to the power stations, which is $880,407,784.14, not $880,407,784.14.
 The student did not calculate the shortfall correctly, which is $963,700,000 - $880,407,784.14 = $83,292,215.86, not $83,292,215.86.","### FEEDBACK: Calculating the Shortfall of Assistance for Power Stations
 
 Dear [Student],
 
 Thank you for submitting your assignment on calculating the shortfall in assistance for power stations in the La Trobe Valley. I appreciate the effort you put into analyzing the data provided by the Commonwealth Government.
 
 To calculate the shortfall, we first need to determine the total amount of assistance given to the power stations and the total amount they will pay for carbon pollution in the next financial year.
 
 According to the article, the total amount of assistance is $880,407,784.14, and the total amount they will pay for carbon pollution in the next financial year is $963,700,000. 
 
 To find the shortfall, we subtract the total amount they will pay from the total amount of assistance:
 
 $880,407,784.14 (assistance) - $963,700,000 (payment) = -$83,292,215.86
 
 This means that the power stations will have to pay a shortfall of $83,292,215.86 in the next financial year.
 
 To put this into perspective, consider the estimated total emissions of the power stations: 41.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. At the legislated rate of $23 per tonne of emissions, this translates to an annual emission of 1,456,900,000 tonnes.
 
 The shortfall of $83,292,215.86 represents a 5.8% shortfall in the annual emission budget, which is equivalent to a 0.48% increase in electricity prices.
 
 As you can see, the calculation process was straightforward, and the results provide valuable insights into the impact of carbon price legislation on the power stations.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns regarding this calculation. I am here to help.
 
 Best regards,

 Howard Zinn is one of the country's most beloved and respected historians, the author of numerous books and plays, and a passionate activist for radical change. Zinn has placed himself at the center of the most important historical moments of the last thirty years, during which
 he has been admired as a writer and an important political and moral voice.
 At the age of 18, Zinn was a shipyard worker; at 21 an Air Force bombardier. Both experiences helped shape a radical impulse, an opposition to war, and a passion for history. After getting his Ph.D. from Columbia University in history, he taught at Spelman College, where he worked with young Civil Rights activists including Alice Walker and Marian Wright Edelman. Zinn led anti-war protests, went to Vietnam with Daniel Berrigan and testified in his friend, Daniel Ellsberg's Pentagon Papers trial. Zinn's politically engaged life brought him into many arenas - imprisonment for civil disobedience, fights for open debate in universities, and activist work from the Vietnam era to the present.
 Zinn is the author of numerous books and plays including the classic, ""A People's History of the United States"" and the newly-released companion volume ""Voices of a People's History"". Other Zinn titles include ""Terrorism and War"", ""Declarations of Independence"", ""Artists in Times of War"", ""You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train: A Personal History of Our Times"", ""The Zinn Reader"", ""Emma and Marx in Soho"". Zinn is also the subject of a new documentary film - ""You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train"" - that is already garnering critical and public acclaim. His classic, ""A People's History of the United States ,"" has gone into more than 25 printings and is widely used in college and university classrooms. Whether his subject is war, race, politics, economic justice or history itself, Zinn speaks and writes with clarity and humor.

 Analyzing the Intersection of Activism and Academia in Howard Zinn's Life and Work
 
 Using specific examples from the text, explain how Howard Zinn's life experiences, including his time as a shipyard worker, Air Force bombardier, and Civil Rights activist, influenced his historical perspective and shaped his passion for radical change.
 Consider Zinn's concept of 'a people's history.' What does it signify, and how does it relate to his broader ideas on war, economic justice, and politics?
 Imagine you are a historian tasked with including Howard Zinn's life and work in a broader historical narrative. What aspects of his legacy would you highlight, and why?
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 To answer the question of how Howard Zinn's life experiences influenced his historical perspective and shaped his passion for radical change, it is evident that Zinn's experiences as a shipyard worker and Air Force bombardier instilled in him a sense of social responsibility and critigue of war, however the text does not explain this, Zinn's work with Civil Rights activists including Alice Walker and Marian Wright Edelman further solidified his commitment to fighting for social justice.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: 
 Your analysis of Howard Zinn's life and work is mostly accurate, but there are some areas for improvement.
 
 While you mentioned that Zinn's experiences instilled a sense of social responsibility and critiqued war, you didn't provide specific examples from the text to support this claim. For instance, you could have mentioned his time in the Air Force, where he was a bombardier, and how this experience shaped his views on war. Additionally, you could have explored how his experiences as a Civil Rights activist, such as working with young activists like Alice Walker and Marian Wright Edelman, influenced his historical perspective.
 Your response to task 3 is incomplete. While you mentioned that Zinn's legacy would include aspects such as his work with the Civil Rights Movement, his critique of war, and his commitment to social justice, you didn't provide a clear explanation of what these aspects would entail. For example, you could have discussed how Zinn's concept of 'a people's history' would be reflected in his work, such as through the publication of 'A People's History of the United States' or his involvement in documentary films like 'You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train: A Personal History of Our Times'.","### FEEDBACK: ANALYSIS OF HOW HOWARD ZINN'S LIFE EXPERIENCES INFLUENCED HIS HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE AND SHAPED HIS PASSION FOR RADICAL CHANGE
 
 1. **Influence of Personal Experiences**: Howard Zinn's life experiences, including his time as a shipyard worker and Air Force bombardier, played a significant role in shaping his historical perspective. These experiences instilled in him a sense of social responsibility and critiqued the destructive nature of war.

 |Johann Reichhart (center) was born into a family of executioners.|
 The young girl moved impassively into the shadow of the guillotine which would end her life. It was 5pm on February 22, 1943, and darkness was already falling outside.
 In the death chamber at Munich‚Äôs Stadelheim Prison, 21-year-old Sophie Scholl would pay with her life for distributing leaflets decrying Adolf Hitler .
 ‚ÄúSuch a fine, sunny day, and I have to go, but what does my death matter if through us, thousands of people are awakened and stirred to action?‚Äù said Sophie as her executioner looked on.
 In a long black coat, white shirt, black bow tie and top hat, Johann Reichhart was just three years older than the girl whose life he was about to end.
 Reichhart took 3,165 lives during his time as Germany‚Äôs chief executioner. Ironically, after the collapse of the Third Reich , he would hang some of those he once served, Nazi war criminals, on behalf of the victorious Allies.
 The beheadings of Sophie Scholl, her brother Hans and a third member of The White Rose, their student resistance group, were among 2,873 executions he carried out in the Second World War.
 ‚ÄúHead Hunter‚Äù Reichhart‚Äôs extraordinary life is the subject of The Curse Of Hitler‚Äôs Executioner, the first episode of a new series of Forbidden History, on the Yesterday channel tonight.
 Marc von Luke, a journalist who has written about Reichhart, said: ‚ÄúHe killed quickly, efficiently and without remorse. Under the Nazi regime, Johann Reichhart despatched criminals and resistance fighters, and after the end of the war he hung up Nazis for the Allies. Until the end of his life, he believed in the benefits of the death penalty.
 ‚ÄúReichhart had the ambition to become the best hangman in Germany, sure that he was a master of his art. No one was going to kill faster than he did.
 ‚ÄúHe served the Nazis, but he served the Weimar Republic and the Allies too. It was the profession which was important, not the government of the day. He was simply good at his job.‚Äù
 Reichhart was born on April 29, 1893, in Wichenbach into a family of executioners going back eight generations.
 In the First World War, he served in the trenches. In peacetime he was a driver, butcher and pub landlord.
 On March 23, 1924, he applied to the Bavarian State Ministry of Justice in Munich for the position of executioner after the retirement of his uncle Xavier.
 The administration promised him 150 Goldmarks for each execution, and announced: ‚ÄúFrom April 1, 1924, Reichhart takes over the execution of all death sentences coming in the Free State of Bavaria to the execution by beheading with the guillotine.‚Äù
 |Hans Scholl (left), Sophie Scholl (center) and Christoph Probst|
 He had practised with mannequins and a corpse but now was the real thing.
 Reichhart positioned Fischer exactly beneath the guillotine blade hanging eight feet above him.
 He released the locking lever and the blade whooshed down, severing Fischer‚Äôs head, which rolled into a basket as Reichhart pronounced the words he would recite over and over in the coming years: ‚ÄúThe verdict is executed.‚Äù
 A series of life imprisonments and pardons towards the end of the 1920s caused him to write to bosses in 1929: ‚ÄúMy last execution was in Kempten on January 20, 1928. Since all the murderers condemned to death had been pardoned, I was so hindered in my business journeys that I did not earned a penny for a week.‚Äù
 He gave it up that year and went to Holland, where he became a fruit and veg salesman. But he returned to his true calling after Hitler became Chancellor in January 1933.
 He joined several Nazi organisations, such as the party‚Äôs motoring corps, but did not become a party member until 1937.
 He was soon an integral cog in the state machinery of terror and death, and was given an Opel Blitz to get to execution sites as the Nazis despatched their enemies one by one.
 Reichhart invented a device called the ‚Äúdouble detective tongs‚Äù ‚Äì a metal clamp which held the prisoner beneath the guillotine instead of rope. He got an execution down to four seconds flat.
 During the war his record for the most executions in one day was 32. He was so determined to be punctual at all his ‚Äúappointments‚Äù he asked the transport ministry if he could be spared speeding tickets. His request was denied.
 In 1943, he performed 764 decapitations as one of three executioners employed in the Third Reich. Southern Germany, Austria, and the Bohemia region of the Czech Republic were his domain.
 After the failed assassination attempt on Hitler in 1944, the bloodlust of the Nazis increased. Reichhart was ordered to Berlin as the officers and intellectuals bound up in Operation Valkyrie ‚Äì the plot to overthrow of the Nazi state ‚Äì were snuffed out.
 Reichhart was married and had three children. One of his sons, Hans, would commit suicide in 1950 because of the ‚Äútaint‚Äù of his father‚Äôs profession, and the siblings recalled the taunts of other children at school: ‚ÄúHeadcutter, headcutter, your dad‚Äôs a headcutter!‚Äù
 Traitors, defeatists, those who listened to the BBC on the radio ‚Äì all fell victim to the man dubbed ‚ÄúHead Hunter‚Äù.
 But when the Reich collapsed in 1945, new masters came for him. In May that year, American soldiers, calling him a ‚ÄúNazi bastard,‚Äù took him into custody.
 He was not behind bars for long. His unique skill made him useful to the Allies and, in their service, he ended the lives of 156 low-rank Nazi war criminals.
 The first of these to die by hanging were three German civilians, executed in November 1945 for killing downed American pilots.
 Later Reichhart had to justify himself at a de-Nazification court, where he said: ‚ÄúI have carried out death sentences in the firm conviction that I should serve the state with my work, and to comply with lawfully enacted laws. I never doubted the legality of what I was doing.‚Äù
 Jamie Theakston, who presents Forbidden History, believes Riechhart embodied the dark side of German efficiency. He says: ‚ÄúReichhart developed his own guillotine modelled on the traditional French guillotine, but lighter and more mobile. It‚Äôs horrific to think of it.
 ‚ÄúOne of the reasons he ended up working for the Allies was that there were not a lot of people prepared to do that kind of thing.‚Äù
 The death penalty was outlawed in West Germany‚Äôs constitution in 1949, but Reichhart supported its reintroduction in the 1960s after a series of taxi driver murders.
 Reichhart ended his days alone and lonely, first breeding dogs and making perfume, and later being looked after in a care home near Munich, where he died in 1972.

Consider examining the ways in which his conviction in the morality of his work was tested by the demands of his role as an executioner, and how this intersected with his personal beliefs and values.","### FEEDBACK: EVALUATING THE MORAL IMPLICATIONS OF REICHHART'S PROFESSION
 
 As we delve into the life of Johann Reichhart, the chief executioner of Germany during the Nazi regime, we are met with a complex and multifaceted picture. On the surface, Reichhart's occupation appears to be a stark contrast to his personal values and beliefs, particularly in the context of the Holocaust. However, upon closer examination, it becomes clear that the moral implications of Reichhart's profession were far more nuanced and influenced by his personal circumstances.
 
 ### THE ROLE OF REICHHART AS GERMANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIONER
 
 Reichhart's position as Germany's chief executioner was a pivotal aspect of the Nazi regime's efforts to maintain control and crush dissent. As the chief executioner, Reichhart was responsible for overseeing the execution of thousands of individuals, including those accused of treason, resistance fighters, and other perceived enemies of the state. This role was instrumental in the Nazi regime's efforts to maintain its power and legitimacy.
 
 ### THE TENSION BETWEEN REICHHART'S PROFESSION AND HIS PERSONAL BELIEFS
 
 Despite his profession, Reichhart's actions and decisions often seemed to contradict his personal values and beliefs. In his own words, Reichhart stated that he had ""carried out death sentences in the firm conviction that I should serve the state with my work, and to comply with lawfully enacted laws."" This statement highlights the tension between Reichhart's personal conviction and his government-imposed role.
 
 ### THE POST-WAR PERIOD AND REICHHART'S REACTION
 
 In the aftermath of the war, Reichhart's actions took on a new significance. As he was forced to confront the atrocities committed during the Nazi regime, Reichhart's profession seemed to take precedence over his personal beliefs. He was eventually arrested and charged with war crimes, and in 1949, he was outlawed in West Germany.
 
 ### THE CASE OF SOPHIE SCHOLL AND HER FELLOW WHITE ROSE MEMBERS
 
 The story of Sophie Scholl and her fellow White Rose members serves as a poignant reminder of the tension between moral conviction and government-imposed laws. These young individuals, who were determined to resist the Nazi regime, were ultimately caught and executed for their actions. Their story highlights the human cost of the Holocaust and the devastating consequences of government-imposed laws.
 
 ### CONCLUSION
 
 In conclusion, the moral implications of Johann Reichhart's profession as Germany's chief executioner were far more complex and nuanced than initially meets the eye. Despite his occupation, Reichhart's actions and decisions often seemed to contradict his personal values and beliefs. The post-war period and Reichhart's reaction to the atrocities committed during the Nazi regime serve as a poignant reminder of the tension between moral conviction and government-imposed laws. Ultimately, Reichhart's story serves as a powerful reminder of the devastating consequences of allowing government power to override individual conscience.
 
 ### FEEDBACK RECOMMENDATION:
 
 The provided text could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the moral implications of Reichhart's profession. A more nuanced exploration of the tension between his personal beliefs and his government-imposed role could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complexities involved. Additionally, the inclusion of more context-specific examples, such as the impact of Reichhart's actions on his personal life and the relationships he formed with others, could further enhance the reader's understanding of the situation.",A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research
 Researchers already know that chronic misuse of alcohol can cause widespread damage to the brain. While previous studies examined cortical atrophy in individuals with alcoholism, none examined alcohol-associated atrophy using cortical thickness measurements to obtain a regional mapping of tissue loss across the full cortical surface. This study does so, finding that alcohol damage occurs in gradations: the more alcohol consumed, the greater the damage.
 Results will be published in the December 2011 issue of Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research and are currently available at Early View.
 ""Before advances in neuroimaging technology, the degree to which alcohol affects the brain across different levels of alcohol use, and how it may interact with other health factors, was unclear,"" said Catherine Brawn Fortier, a neuropsychologist and researcher at the VA Boston Healthcare System and Harvard Medical School as well as corresponding author for the study. ""We now know that alcohol has wide ranging effects across the entire cortex and in structures of the brain that contribute to a wide range of psychological abilities and intellectual functions. This is the first study to precisely measure the variation in the thickness of the cerebral cortex, which is the thin layer of neurons that one sees on the surface of the brain and supports all higher-level human cognition.""
 Fortier explained that the brain is usually divided up into two broad kinds of tissues: gray matter, consisting of neurons which are the critical cells that support brain function; and white matter, consisting of the connections among large groups of those cells. Alcohol has an impact on both gray and white matter, with the greatest impact affecting parts of the brain called the frontal and temporal lobes. ""These brain areas are critical to learning new information and, even more importantly, in self-regulation, impulse control, and the modification of all complicated human behaviors,"" she said. ""In other words, the very parts of the brain that may be most important for controlling problem drinking are damaged by alcohol, and the more alcohol consumed, the greater the damage.""
 Fortier and her colleagues compared high-resolution structural magnetic resonance scans from 65 participants in two demographic groups: 31 abstinent alcoholic participants (20 men, 11 women) and 34 nonalcoholic control participants (20 men, 14 women). Images were used to create cortical-surface models, and cortical thickness was then estimated as the distance between the gray matter/white matter boundary and the outer cortical surface.
 ""Previous studies were only able to compare large brain regions,"" said Fortier, ""whereas this method allowed us to look at areas as small as a tenth of a millimeter and compare them across the entire brain. This approach allowed us to identify very subtle but significant alcohol-related damage across the entire brain revealing two primary findings. First, the outermost layer of cortex across the entire brain was reduced in our sample of recovered alcoholics. Second, alcohol's effect on the brain is continuous across a wide range of drinking behavior and appears to be dose specific. Pathology is often thought of as occurring as an all-or-none phenomenon‚Äîyou either have brain damage or you don't. This study shows that the damage occurs in gradations, and the more you drink, the greater the damage.""
 ""This study documents, for the first time, the dynamic nature of the neuropathology associated with chronic heavy alcohol use,"" added Terence M. Keane, associate chief of staff for research & development at the VA Boston Healthcare System and assistant dean for research at Boston University School of Medicine, ""and is a major concern among the veterans that both of us serve. The results may explain why alcoholism may be so difficult to treat: alcohol damages the very neural systems that are critical to achieving and maintaining abstinence.""
 ""A widespread reduction in cortical tissue in recovered alcoholics indicates that even with abstinence, cognitive abilities are compromised in former drinkers,"" said Fortier. ""Severe reductions in frontal brain regions can result in a dramatic change to personality and behavior, taking the form of impulsivity, difficulty with self-monitoring, planning, reasoning, poor attention span, inability to alter behavior, a lack of awareness of inappropriate behavior, mood changes, even aggression. Severe reductions in temporal brain regions most often result in impairments in memory and language function.""
 ""This study represents a technological and methodological tour de force,"" said Keane, ""documenting with great precision how widespread the effects of alcohol use are on the cerebral cortex and how those effects may change with abstinence. These results will ultimately be important for clinicians, patients and their families because they show that the brain is very sensitive to all levels of alcohol use and that abstinence may result in some reversal of damage and presumably mental abilities. The results also provide the intriguing observation that the brain damage of alcohol is part of what makes abstinence and recovery so difficult.""
 ""I think what is most important for other medical professionals to know and pass on to their patients is that alcohol misuse is not without consequences,"" said Fortier. Not only is the brain impacted, but the very brain structures that are the most impacted are the ones that you need to change problematic behavior. However, it is also important to note that although brain tissue is compromised by alcohol, it can recover to some degree with maintained abstinence. This could be a motivational factor in maintaining sobriety.""

 Alcohol and Your Brain: A Teen's Guide to Smart Choices
 Did you know that excessive drinking can do some serious damage to your brain? Imagine your brain as a high-performance computer - when you drink too much, it's like overloading the system with viruses and bugs. The more you drink, the more harm you cause to your brain's hardware, specifically the frontal and temporal lobes. These areas are crucial for decision-making, problem-solving, and memory - essential tools for school and life. But that's not all. Chronic heavy drinking can lead to impulsivity, mood swings, and aggressive behavior. It's like your brain's software is malfunctioning, making it harder to control your actions and emotions. So, what's the bottom line? Underage drinking is not worth the risk. By choosing to abstain, you're investing in a healthy, high-functioning brain that will serve you well throughout your life. Think smart, think safe - your brain will thank you.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: ALCOHOL AND YOUR BRAIN
 
 As a responsible and informed teen, you're probably aware of the risks associated with underage drinking. But have you ever stopped to think about the incredible damage that heavy drinking can cause to your brain? Think of your brain as a high-performance computer - when you drink too much, it's like overloading the system with viruses and bugs.
 
 The frontal and temporal lobes, areas critical to decision-making, problem-solving, and memory, are the most affected by heavy drinking. These regions are responsible for controlling your impulses, emotions, and behavior. But when you drink too much, these areas can become ""malfunctioning,"" leading to a range of problems, from impulsivity and mood swings to aggressive behavior.
 
 The consequences of underage drinking can be devastating. Chronic heavy drinking can lead to long-term changes in personality, behavior, and cognitive abilities. It's not just about getting drunk and then getting back on the couch - it's about the cumulative damage to your brain over time.
 
 So, what's the bottom line? Underage drinking is not worth the risk. By choosing to abstain, you're investing in a healthy, high-functioning brain that will serve you well throughout your life. Think smart, think safe - your brain will thank you.

 The return to school in September is always a funny thing: there‚Äôs a mix of nerves and excitement about meeting your students, as well as the stress of sorting lessons. And this year, back to school will be even more strange than usual: thanks to COVID, it will be the first time in six months we‚Äôve seen many of our students face-to-face. However, as we reach the end of this year, there‚Äôs at least one thing you can tick off your list for September: KS3 planning. Beyond has created a KS3 English Curriculum Map to do all the hard work for you‚Ä¶
 Introducing the KS3 English Curriculum Map
 Beyond‚Äôs KS3 English Curriculum Map is essentially a plan for every KS3 class, for every lesson, all year. It features the best of Beyond‚Äôs KS3 resources, covering every one of the aims in the National Curriculum for English. In short, it‚Äôs your KS3 planning, sorted. Which means you have the headspace to focus on being outstanding.
 Resources to cover every aspect of the KS3 English curriculum
 Each half term on the KS3 Curriculum Map suggests a scheme of work from Beyond which can be downloaded at a click. Each scheme is differentiated and includes engaging, challenging lessons, a homework pack, an assessment pack and a unit overview so you can see what you‚Äôre teaching and when. The map includes schemes of work on classics such as A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream and Moonfleet, as well as contemporary literature such as Of Mice and Men and Blood Brothers. There are units on Pop and Poetry and Dystopian Fiction, as well as a Whodunnit-themed non-fiction unit and a series on Non-Fiction Reading. There‚Äôs a wealth of exciting, innovative lessons to explore.
 The map includes an overview for the whole of KS3, more detailed summaries for each year group, and a table which shows exactly which National Curriculum for English aims are being met in which schemes.
 And of course, like all of our resources, everything on the map has been written by qualified, experienced teachers and designed and illustrated by professionals. You‚Äôre an outstanding teacher, so you deserve outstanding resources.
 We‚Äôre aware that school budgets are tighter than ever before, so wherever possible, we‚Äôve included copies of the texts being used ‚Äì for example, you‚Äôll find that all of our literary heritage texts are included in the schemes of work. For more modern plays, novels and poems that are still under copyright, we‚Äôve opted for texts that we know many schools will have already, or we‚Äôve highlighted suggested short extracts that could be used. So, for example, our Seminal World Literature unit, Black American Experiences in Literature, will include a suggested extract from the modern bestseller, The Hate U Give.
 At the start of every year, there‚Äôs a short reading and writing scheme with assessments, so that you can establish baseline levels for your students. And if you wanted to record those levels and monitor progress throughout KS3, there‚Äôs also a Performance Indicators Sheet, so you can measure pupil progress against National Curriculum objectives.
 The KS3 Curriculum Map doesn‚Äôt just include schemes of work, either. There are also SPaG resources for each half term, and Library Skills booklets covering every week of KS3 (that‚Äôs 108 lessons!), developing skills such as research, note-taking and independent learning. There are even suggestions for seasonal resources for events such as Black History Month and World Book Day, so you never have to scrabble around for topical activities the night before!
 We hope teachers everywhere find this map useful. We‚Äôd love to hear feedback, and we know there are always more resources we can create to make it even better! Our aim is to create the headspace for you to be outstanding. Whether you use just one resource or decide to use the whole map for your KS3 curriculum, we‚Äôre glad we could help to reduce the stress a little bit, as September looms closer. Everyone knows teachers are superheroes, but even superheroes need a sidekick sometimes‚Ä¶

 Your Body Needs Essential Fatty Acids
 With the boom of fast food chains, deep fried as well as super coated in sugar foods have become a staple meal of most people especially those living in the city. Top this unhealthy eating with sedentary and unhealthy lifestyle and you have the perfect recipe for disaster. Many people today, even the younger ones are at risk of various serious heart diseases as well as diabetes which can lead to complicated illnesses and even death.
 The great news is there has been a movement to combat this problem. More people are becoming conscious about how healthy they are. We are now seeing the media tackle the problem of obesity and unhealthy eating. You see shows like the Biggest Loser and Heavy that aim to educate the people on how to eat healthy and live a healthy lifestyle.
 You probably have been hearing about essential fatty acids mentioned in these shows and even in TV ads. But what are they really and how essential are they to our body? You read food labels with essential fatty acids (EFAs) or with Omega 3 or Omega 6 but do you know what these nutrients are?
 EFAs are nutritional elements that the human body needs however it is not capable of producing them. We get the EFAs that we need from various food sources. Omega 3 and Omega 6 are two types of EFAs. Omega 3 can be found in fish oils and plant oils while Omega 6 is found in plant oils. Omega 9 is another essential fatty acid that can be produced by the body from ingestion of Omega 3 and Omega 6. One can get Omega 9 from plant oils as well.
 In Northern European countries, many people are suffering from degenerative diseases like heart disease, cancer, arthritis, asthma and even certain disorders in the functioning of the brain like depression and the now very common disorder in children ADHD or Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder.
 How Beneficial are EFAs?
 - EFAs are necessary in many bodily processes. They play a major role in the formation of healthy cell membranes as well as proper cognitive development and functioning of our brain and the nervous system. They are also crucial in the production of hormones and proper thyroid and adrenal activity.
 - EFAs also aid in regulating our blood pressure, functioning of the liver as well as inflammatory and immune responses. Omega 6 is known to help blood clot while Omega 3 prevents over clotting. Therefore it is necessary that your body has a balance of these two essential fatty acids.
 - EFAs also transport and break down the cholesterol in our body. By preventing build up of cholesterol, heart diseases are avoided. EFAs also benefit the skin and hair.
 Omega 6 in Argan Oil
 A great source of the Omega 6 is Argan oil. This oil from Morocco has been hailed as a miracle oil and is popular in the beauty industry because of its benefits to the skin and hair. However the Argan oil can also be used in dishes. A drizzle of Argan oil on your salads and grilled dishes would give you a potent dose of the much needed Omega 6.
 - Essential Fatty Acids, Just What Are their Benefits?
 - Essential Nutrients for the Body
 - Is Vitamin E Essential to the Body?
 - Can Fat be Good?
 - Facial and Body Care for the Winter Season
 Filed Under: Argan Oil in General \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Design a public awareness ad for promoting the importance of Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs) in our diet.
 
 Imagine you are working for a health organization, and your task is to create an eye-catching ad for social media or a local newspaper.
 Use one of the benefits of EFAs mentioned in the article as the central theme of your ad.
 Don't forget to include a clear and concise message, along with an image or a slogan that grabs the audience's attention.
 Be creative and think about how you can make your ad stand out and persuade people to include EFAs in their diet.

Choose EFAs Today!', Central Theme: Reduced risk of heart disease.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: DESIGN A PUBLIC AWARENESS AD FOR PROMOTING THE IMPORTANCE OF ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS (EFAS)
 
 **Feedback:**
 
 - The ad effectively uses a split-screen image to grab attention and emphasize the importance of EFAs.
 - The central theme of reduced risk of heart disease is clear and concise, aligning with the article's message.
 - The slogan 'Healthy Heart, Happy Life. Choose EFAs Today!' is catchy and encourages engagement.
 - However, the message could be improved by providing a specific call-to-action (CTA) or a clear instruction on how to incorporate EFAs into one's diet.
 
 **Feedback Provisions:**
 
 - **Content Clarity:** The ad could benefit from a clearer explanation of what EFAs are and their benefits. A brief paragraph or two explaining the importance of EFAs in our diet would provide more context and engagement.
 - **Visuals:** The split-screen image is effective, but consider adding more visuals to break up the text and make the ad more visually appealing.
 - **CTA:** Adding a specific CTA, such as a website URL or a social media handle, would encourage viewers to take action and learn more about EFAs.
 - **Slogan:** While the slogan is catchy, it could be more effective if it was more specific to the benefits of EFAs. For example, 'Choose EFAs for a Heart Healthy Life' or 'Boost Your Heart Health with EFAs.'
 
 **Feedback Suggestions:**
 
 - Consider adding a brief paragraph explaining the importance of EFAs in our diet, including their role in healthy cell membranes, cognitive development, and thyroid and adrenal activity.
 - Use a more specific and relevant visual to break up the text and make the ad more engaging.
 - Add a clear CTA, such as a website URL or a social media handle, to encourage viewers to learn more about EFAs.
 - Use a more catchy and relevant slogan that emphasizes the benefits of EFAs.

"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
 I have started to read Teaching Unprepared Students by Kathleen L. Gabriel. I heard about the book in an ad for a session at my College‚Äôs Center for Teaching Excellence and Innovation. So far I‚Äôve completed three chapters. I‚Äôll probably add more posts on this book as I read.
 In Chapter 2 Gabriel gives her teaching philosophy. I‚Äôve memorized it as RSST+. (I say ‚Äúrust plus.‚Äù) The plus is the fact that the philosophy‚Äôs top principle is that any can learn. The rest of the philosophy tells what a student must do to succeed and by implication how a teacher can support that learning. The R represents that responsibility lies with the students. The S‚Äôs represent student self-reliance- faculty shouldn‚Äôt do things students can do themselves and the fact that learning, as with anything worthwhile, is a struggle. The T represents the fact that big changes require lots of time. Faculty must be willing to put in the time if the students are willing. Faculty must be willing to train the students to be self-reliant. The examples indicate that strategies based on this philosophy can change the lives of a few students dramatically. If most of a class were made of underprepared students there is no panacea to address that.
 Chapter 3 talks about early semester suggestions. Some seem like they would only help a novice teacher. For instance she suggests using a syllabus and suggests content and organization for a syllabus. She also mentions setting goals for the course.
 I did pick up two ideas to implement in Chapter 3. There is a list of 13 study behaviors that successful students use. The implementation was for students to check the ones they used and then add the checks to create score. If they did almost all the behaviors the scoring guide predicted an A in the class, if students claimed they would do most of the behaviors the scoring guide predicted and B and so on. I think the scoring part is misleading, but a discussion of these strategies would be worthwhile and would give students guidance on how to study.
 The author also recommends asking students to write a short paragraph about why they are taking the class. While on the surface this can help you tailor your examples to suit student interests it also lets you know which students have trouble writing. As we have no writing requirement in our math classes this would be a valuable piece of information about the students. I used to have more writing in my algebra classes. The lack of a prerequisite made this difficult to do. I think I may get back to using writing next semester starting with this simple assignment.
 So far I also fear Gabriel‚Äôs experience is too focused on her own colllege. She cites drop/add policies and policies for accomodating learning disabled students that I know vary from school to school. She seemed to think her school‚Äôs policies broader. Also the preface is written by the provost at her school.
 Overall I think I will only pick up small good ideas in various parts of the book. That in itself is enough to justify the cost of the book and the time invested in reading it. I still have hope to be surprised by the blockbuster chapter though! \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

 ### ANSWER:
 Sample Syllabus for Math 101: Implementing RSST+ Principles",No,"### FEEDBACK: Sample Syllabus for Math 101: Implementing RSST+ Principles
 
 **Class Syllabus: Math 101**
 
 **Course Description:** This course aims to develop problem-solving skills and critical thinking through mathematical concepts and applications. Students will engage in a collaborative learning environment to foster a growth mindset and self-reliance in mathematical inquiry.
 
 **RSST+ Philosophy Implementation:**
 
 1. **R:** Responsibility lies with the students. Encourage students to take ownership of their learning, set goals, and develop a growth mindset.
 
  - **Implementation:** Students will be expected to set learning goals and objectives at the beginning of each unit, and regularly reflect on their progress. Students will also be encouraged to take responsibility for their own learning, including seeking help from instructors and peers when needed.
 
 2. **S:** Student self-reliance. Foster an environment where students can explore mathematical concepts independently, with minimal guidance.
 
  - **Implementation:** Students will be provided with resources and materials necessary to complete assignments and participate in discussions. However, students will also be encouraged to seek help from instructors and peers when needed, and to take responsibility for their own learning.
 
 3. **T:** Big changes require lots of time. Faculty must be willing to invest time in supporting student learning.
 
  - **Implementation:** Faculty will be expected to allocate sufficient time for students to complete assignments and participate in discussions. Additionally, faculty will be encouraged to provide guidance and support to students, including offering extra help sessions and providing feedback on assignments.
 
 **Adaptations for Underprepared Students:**
 
 While the RSST+ philosophy provides a solid foundation for promoting student self-reliance and faculty support, there are potential limitations and adaptations that can be made to accommodate underprepared students. For instance:
 
 - **Accessibility:** Consider providing accommodations for students with disabilities, such as extended time on assignments or the use of assistive technology.
 - **Support Services:** Ensure that support services, such as tutoring and academic advising, are available to underprepared students, and that faculty are aware of these resources.
 - **Instructor Guidance:** Provide instructors with guidance on how to adapt the RSST+ philosophy to meet the needs of underprepared students, including offering extra help sessions and providing feedback on assignments.
 
 **Limitations:**
 
 - **Lack of Institutional Resources:** The RSST+ philosophy assumes that institutions have adequate resources and support services in place to support student learning. However, institutions may not always have these resources available, particularly in under-resourced settings.
 - **Inconsistent Faculty Support:** Faculty may not always be aware of the RSST+ philosophy or may not be able to adapt it to meet the needs of underprepared students. Instructors may need to be educated on the philosophy and its implementation to effectively support students.
 
 **Reflection:**
 
 The RSST+ philosophy provides a valuable framework for promoting student self-reliance and faculty support in mathematical education. However, its implementation may not always be feasible in all contexts, particularly in under-resourced settings. To effectively adapt the RSST+ philosophy to meet the needs of underprepared students, institutions must prioritize the provision of support services, accommodations, and instructor guidance. By doing so, institutions can create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment that fosters student growth and success.","### FEEDBACK: RSST+ Philosophy Implementation in Diverse Classrooms
 
 The sample syllabus effectively incorporates RSST+ principles, demonstrating a clear understanding of the concept. The implementation of strategies such as student self-reliance, faculty support, and adapting to different learning styles is well-explained.
 To strengthen the syllabus, consider adding concrete examples that illustrate how to effectively implement these strategies in the context of the math class. For instance, you could describe a specific scenario where a teacher could encourage student self-reliance or provide additional support to underprepared students.
 To address the potential limitations and adaptations of RSST+ philosophy, consider adding a section that acknowledges the importance of tailoring the approach to the specific needs of the institution and students. This could involve discussing how the syllabus could be adapted to accommodate different learning styles, abilities, or cultural backgrounds.
 To further enhance the syllabus, consider including a reflection paragraph that addresses the implications of RSST+ philosophy on teaching and learning. This could involve discussing potential challenges, benefits, or areas for future development.
 Word count is correct at 450-500 words, which meets the requirements.

"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
 The Oxford American Dictionary describes mindset as ‚Äúan established set of attitudes held by someone.‚Äù The definition implies stagnation‚Äìsomething that resists change. But great leaders know they can‚Äôt settle for any mental model that limits their potential.
 We develop a ‚Äúmindset‚Äù from our mental models‚Äìthose ingrained assumptions and generalizations we develop throughout life. These invisible threads of images gradually form the fabric of our thinking, which then influences how we understand the world and how we act and react. Sometimes we don‚Äôt even realize we have developed a mindset.
 If we want to understand our mindset and change it, we must start by turning the mirror inward‚Äìby learning to unearth our internal pictures of the world, to bring them to the surface and hold them robustly to scrutiny.
 In my work with clients, I focus on the mindset leaders need to have to make the right decisions. In high-stakes situations, the decisions leaders make, fail to make, don‚Äôt know they should make, or allow the wrong people to make determine outcomes. Further, these pivotal decisions influence the mindset of others. Though we can‚Äôt observe mindset directly, we can infer the nature of it by the actions people take.
 Mindset determines how we frame issues, what we believe, how we respond to setbacks, and how we interpret emotions such as fear and motivation.
 My most successful clients embrace what I call a Learning Mindset. This mental model sets the stage for developing all other mindsets.
 - They focus on the openness needed to unearth shortcomings in their present ways of seeing the world.
 - They understand how their own actions create the problems they experience.
 - They resist the temptation to make decisions in isolation. Rather, they understand how their position interacts with the larger system.
 - They ask, ‚ÄúWhat might I learn by considering what I‚Äôm hearing?‚Äù
 - They allow excitement, curiosity, passion, and achievement-drive to guide their decisions and actions.
 - They develop both skills of reflection and skills of inquiry.
 - They control their own fears and try to mitigate the negative emotions of others.
 Leaders with a Learning Mindset don‚Äôt ignore, diminish, or deny fear; they accept it. They realize focusing on fear, even when trying to reduce it, won‚Äôt prove productive. Instead, they allow themselves and others to experience it but then give people things to do that provide a sense of accomplishment and momentum-the antidotes to the immobility fear can cause.
 They also refuse to second-guess their tough calls; they ask for help from trusted advisors; and they eschew unsolicited feedback. Most of all, they trust their abilities to sail in uncharted seas.
 The decision-making process involves more than evaluating what we see and hear; it‚Äôs a biological process. Cognition is part physiological, part psychological, and part contextual-but it‚Äôs not always rational. Leaders who have a mindset that leads to successful deals reduce the risk of cognitive biases and decision traps. They are systemic thinkers, discerning as well as curious. They remain open to new ideas without being na√Øve, and they avoid the trap of hubris.
 A Learning Mindset recognizes that challenges aren‚Äôt permanent; talented people can figure things out; and even failure isn‚Äôt fatal. This allows leaders to learn from past missteps and helps them move past them, so people and organizations can thrive.
 We venerate our sacred cows, traditions, and conventional approaches because they make us feel secure. But like all emotional security blankets, they unravel, and their usefulness fades. When we replace emotional responses with new attitudes and cognitive skills, and we challenge ourselves to take risks, reframe, and live well-thought-out beliefs instead of clinging to what we‚Äôve always done, we open the door for new opportunities and optimism. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
 In the previous post, we had mentioned that we will look into other aspects of the painting. So, we begin this post with understanding certain unique compositional characteristics of artist Maniam‚Äôs paintings.
 In the above illustration, there are two main elements which are strategically placed to give focus to the main theme of the scene ‚Äì ‚ÄòThe Royal Coronation‚Äô. The plate with the Royal crown, sword and garland looks as if it is flying without a base. And the size of the standing Rajaraja Cholan is much larger compared to other people in the courtroom.
 If you use your hand to cover Rajarajan and the plate, the elements of foreground and the background look perfectly in proportion. But the introducing of these two elements which are slightly larger in scale, the artist breaks the perspective without disturbing the visual aesthetics. It is not new in traditional art that the object of greater importance in a painting to be bigger in scale than other objects. But delivering this in a beautiful way definitely requires good skill.
 Analysing his works made me curious about who had inspired him to draw. It was his paternal uncle Lingayyah (who was only 4 or 5 years older to him). Uncle Lingayyah used to draw out of his own interest. It seems he would sit quietly on the thinnai (the front porch of a traditional South Indian home, which used to serve as a resting place for visitors) outside his home and draw people walking along Ponnambala Vadhiyar street in Mylapore. At that time, Sri S Rajam (Artist/musicologist) who was a very close friend of uncle Lingayyah, a neighbour Sri Vittal Rao and Sri Maniam used to watch him in action. That inspired all of them to pursue drawing as a hobby which later developed into their career. Only Sri Vittal Rao served in Reserve bank but still continued to paint all his life. He is now 86 yrs old and is one among a few we consult regarding artist Maniam‚Äôs childhood days.
 Here is another illustration by Sri. Maniam on the subject of Alexander the Great. Let us look at how he composed the character of this image (late 1960s for Kalki Magazine).
 Artist Maniam has skilfully brought out the main identities that Alexander the Great was known for. The first thing that comes to our mind about Alexander is his army, leadership quality, his valour and strength. If you look at the area where Alexander stands, there are actually four representations of him starting from the one on horse, one in action, one standing and one close up of the face with his soldier‚Äôs helmet. The way these figures are aligned gives the effect of how he rose to power and marked his identity.
 The above illustration was made in early 1960‚Äôs (for Gangai magazine) for another historical novel. The manner in which the main character is portrayed and the way he has handled various elements in this riot scene is visually effective (take time to observe the illustration). We can actually hear the thunder, feel the strength of wind, the heat from the fire and emotion of every character in this composition.
 Comparing all three illustrations, it is very clear that the size of the main character is dominant in all three compositions and the two colour painting process has been handled skilfully. Combining studies and techniques from western and Indian art to make the scene visually effective was indigenous to artist Maniam. Though he discontinued from The School of Arts during his second year, he never stopped learning. Every work that he had done was a result of a great deal of research and knowledge gained from various sources and we are now trying to understand those facets of his works.
 In the next post, we will go in to the visual characterisation of various characters from Ponniyin Selvan.
 Podcast of a radio interview of Sri Maniam Selven (about his life as an artist) conducted by Mr.Sri (Bay area, California) for his show on KZSU Stanford 90.1 fm on 9th February 2011 is available at www.itsdiff.com. Please follow the link to listen to the podcast. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Analyzing Composition in Sri Maniam's Paintings
 
 Compare and contrast the compositional techniques used by Sri Maniam in the three illustrations (The Royal Coronation, Alexander the Great, and the riot scene) to convey the main theme and characterize the dominant figure. Consider the use of scale, placement, color, and alignment in your analysis. Please provide specific examples from the text to support your argument.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 The three illustrations by Sri Maniam showcase distinct yet cohesive compositional techniques that convey the main theme and emphasize the dominant figure. In all three, the use of scale plays a significant role, with the principal character depicted larger than the rest to draw focus and establish hierarchy. For instance, in The Royal Coronation, the standing Rajaraja Cholan is much larger than the other people in the courtroom, while in Alexander the Great, the main subject is represented in four different stances, each aligned to demonstrate his rise to power. The use of placement also serves to draw attention to the main theme. In The Royal Coronation, the strategically placed plate with the Royal crown, sword, and garland creates a sense of visual tension and directs the viewer's gaze to the coronation scene. The alignment of the figures in Alexander the Great creates a sense of movement and energy, conveying the subject's leadership qualities. In contrast, the riot scene utilizes a range of colors and chaotic alignment to evoke a sense of turmoil and disorder, while the dominant figure remains centered and imposing. However, it is also clear that Sri Maniam's compositional techniques were not always harmonious and were sometimes disrupted by other visual aspects that pushes human perceiver to more actively cognitively integrate disparate pieces of sensory information to understand/better grasp at his main initiative",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: COMPOSITION ANALYSIS OF SRI MANIAM'S PICTURES
 
 **Strengths:**
 
 1. **Effective use of scale:** The principal characters in all three illustrations are depicted larger than the rest, which draws the viewer's attention to the main theme. This technique effectively conveys the dominant figure and establishes hierarchy.
 2. **Placement and alignment:** The strategically placed plate in The Royal Coronation, the four representations of Alexander the Great in The Royal Coronation, and the chaotic alignment in the riot scene all contribute to the visual tension and draw the viewer's gaze to the main theme.
 3. **Color and contrast:** The use of contrasting colors and bold brushstrokes in the riot scene creates a visually effective and dynamic composition.
 
 **Weaknesses:**
 
 1. **Disrupted harmony:** The compositional techniques sometimes disrupt the harmony of the illustrations, which can be jarring for the viewer. This may be due to the use of different visual elements, such as chaotic colors or mismatched placement.
 2. **Overemphasis on scale:** While the use of scale is effective in drawing attention to the main theme, it may become overwhelming in some cases. This could be balanced by using other compositional techniques, such as contrast or color, to create visual interest.
 3. **Lack of cohesion:** The compositional techniques in some illustrations may not be cohesive, with different elements disrupting the overall visual flow. This could be improved by paying closer attention to the relationships between different visual elements.
 
 **Suggestions for improvement:**
 
 1. **Balance scale and harmony:** Consider balancing the use of scale with other compositional techniques, such as contrast or color, to create visual interest and harmony.
 2. **Develop cohesion:** Pay closer attention to the relationships between different visual elements to create a cohesive visual flow.
 3. **Experiment with different techniques:** Consider experimenting with different compositional techniques to find a balance between scale, placement, color, and alignment that works for the specific illustration.
 
 **Additional feedback:**
 
 The analysis of Sri Maniam's paintings provides valuable insights into the compositional techniques used to convey the main theme and characterize the dominant figure. The use of scale, placement, color, and alignment is effective in creating a visually engaging and cohesive composition. However, the compositional techniques sometimes disrupt the harmony of the illustrations, and the use of different visual elements can be jarring for the viewer. By paying closer attention to the relationships between different visual elements and experimenting with different techniques, the viewer can better understand and appreciate the compositional techniques used in Sri Maniam's paintings.","### FEEDBACK: 
 The analysis demonstrates a good understanding of the compositional techniques used by Sri Maniam in the three illustrations, but there are areas that require further development and refinement.
 
 To strengthen the analysis, it would be beneficial to provide more specific examples from the text to support the argument, such as the use of color and alignment in each illustration. This will help to provide a clearer and more detailed comparison between the three illustrations.
 Additionally, it would be helpful to provide more context about the historical and cultural significance of the three illustrations, and how they relate to each other and to Sri Maniam's overall body of work. This will help to provide a more nuanced and comprehensive analysis of his compositional techniques.
 It would also be beneficial to consider the potential limitations and biases of the analysis, such as the influence of personal interpretation and the potential for misinterpretation. This will help to provide a more balanced and nuanced analysis of Sri Maniam's compositional techniques.
 Finally, it would be beneficial to provide more specific examples of how Sri Maniam's compositional techniques have been interpreted and analyzed by art historians and critics. This will help to provide a more comprehensive and nuanced analysis of his work.
 To address the errors, consider the following suggestions:

 Would Obama Be the Nation's First Black President?
 Mr. Payne is the author of Dead Last: The Public Memory of Warren G. Harding's Scandalous Legacy (Ohio University Press, September, 2008). He is an Associate Professor of history at St. Bonaventure University.
 In short, there are two elements to the issue of whether or not Harding (or one of the other four or five possible candidates) was the first black president. The two are linked but one is significantly more important than the other. The first is whether or not Harding had a black ancestor. The second, and the more important, boils down to whether or not there is a racial qualification to be president. Although it seems obvious that all of our presidents have been white, some Americans believe that a few presidents had black ancestors, thereby making them black under the outdated and racist ‚Äúone-drop rule.‚Äù
 Harding is at the top of the list of presidents who have been categorized as black. This line of thought goes back to the obsession that many 19th and early 20th century Americans had with ‚Äúblood lines‚Äù during what is a time when the ‚Äúone drop rule‚Äù was used to define race. Segregationists and Social Darwinists found it important to be able to define race and so argued that any person with a black ancestor was black. In today‚Äôs world, overt racism is frowned upon in the public sphere, people can self-select from a range of ethnicities and races on the census, and intellectuals discuss race as a social construction. Current discussions of ‚Äúpost-racialism‚Äù are a near inversion of the understanding of race that prevailed a century ago. Obama‚Äôs responses to racially charged issues have been measured and stand in a clear contrast to the role that race played in Harding‚Äôs campaign for the presidency in 1920.
 The issue of race was injected into the 1920 presidential campaign as part of an effort to sink the campaign of Harding, the Republican nominee. William Estabrook Chancellor, a professor at the College of Wooster, attempted to destroy Harding‚Äôs candidacy by charging that he was a ‚Äúhybrid,‚Äù an ‚Äúoctoroon‚Äù descended from ‚ÄúNegro‚Äù ancestors. Chancellor was a devoted scientific racist. He was also an avid Democrat who worshipped outgoing president Woodrow Wilson. In short, Chancellor argued that Harding‚Äôs supposed mixed racial ancestry disqualified him for the presidency. He believed that the American public would agree with him, warning Americans that electing Harding could endanger white supremacy.
 What did Chancellor offer as evidence of Harding‚Äôs ancestry? Chancellor found people in central and northern Ohio who were willing to testify that members of the Harding family were black. They offered a variety of stories with little consistency and no hard evidence; indeed, Chancellor and many of those he interviewed dealt in the worst stereotypes of black promiscuity or vague descriptions of physical appearance. Perhaps the only thing more confusing and inconclusive than Chancellor‚Äôs evidence was the genealogy that the Republicans created to counter Chancellor‚Äôs charges in an attempt to document Harding‚Äôs ‚Äúblue-eyed stock.‚Äù Rather famously, Harding refused to comment on the ‚Äúscandal,‚Äù privately noting that for all he knew one of his ancestors might have ‚Äújumped the fence.‚Äù
 Harding‚Äôs era was one of the lowest points in American history for race relations. In reaction against the Great Migration, whites rioted against blacks throughout northern communities (including Harding‚Äôs own hometown of Marion, Ohio) and the recently-revived Ku Klux Klan rose in popularity after the release of Birth of a Nation. As president, Harding spoke out against the Klan and gave a speech in Birmingham that was surprisingly thoughtful for a man who was not supposed to be thoughtful. By modern standards, the speech was not particularly progressive, but he did call for qualified blacks to vote. Of course, they probably would have voted Republican but nonetheless it took courage in 1920 to stand in Alabama and say that. He set America‚Äôs racial difficulties in a national and global context, noting that racial and ethnic tensions plagued the world in the wake of the Great War. Some academic historians have argued that Harding‚Äôs address was the most significant speech on race given by any president since Grant. Indeed, a critical charge against Harding, according to Chancellor, was that Harding was sympathetic to the plight of black Americans. Despite the promise of his speech, African Americans were disappointed with Harding‚Äôs record; in his short administration (two years and five months) Harding did little that benefited African Americans.
 Was Harding the first black president? Only by the dubious standards of the one-drop rule used by Chancellor might Harding have been considered black and even this is not certain. Chancellor‚Äôs research was biased, to say the least. Harding did not identify himself as black. His comment about not knowing if an ancestor had ‚Äújumped the fence‚Äù can hardly be considered a confession of mixed racial ancestry, although it is sometimes seen that way. The racist attacks of men like Chancellor and of some residents of Harding‚Äôs hometown might have made him sensitive about race, but they hardly make him black. Indeed, the vagaries of these charges can be seen in Harding‚Äôs relationship with his father-in-law. Amos Kling opposed his daughter‚Äôs engagement to Warren Harding and, in a pattern that others would follow, tried to destroy him by spreading stories that Harding was a ‚Äúnigger.‚Äù When Harding later became successful, Kling came to accept him. Chancellor and others argued that Harding looked black, that he was ‚Äúdark complected,‚Äù but more frequently, observers noted that Harding looked senatorial, presidential, or Romanesque. These comparisons make it clear that the discussion of Harding‚Äôs race took place within an arena marked by stereotypes and shifting standards.
 Chancellor failed in his efforts to prevent Harding‚Äôs election, but he succeeded in making the story about Harding‚Äôs supposed racial ancestry an enduring part of Harding‚Äôs legacy. The story became relevant during the 1960s in reaction to the Civil Rights Movement and the racial tensions of the time. In the Shadow of Blooming Grove (1968), his biography of Harding, Francis Russell drew upon Chancellor‚Äôs work to make the possibility of African-American ancestry the ‚Äúdark shadow‚Äù that haunted Harding in his professional and political life. J. A. Rogers‚Äôs book, The Five Negro Presidents (1965), raised the idea‚Äîembraced by some African-Americans‚Äîthat several presidents had black ancestry, Harding among them. Rogers‚Äôs very brief book is best read as a critique of racial politics or a proclamation of racial pride but also relies on familiar sources. The most recent example of a black person claiming Harding as a black president is Marsha Stewart's Warren Harding U. S. President 29: Death by Blackness (2005). Stewart is a black woman who claims to be a distant relative of the president; the evidence of her claim is taken from Russell, Chancellor, and family lore.
 Clearly, biography is important in selecting and selling a president. In 1920 Harding ran a front porch campaign that emphasized his Ohio boyhood and small-town background. It was, in a sense, an updating of the log cabin campaign complete with the clich√© that any boy could grow up to be president. Clearly, however, the debate over race and the presidency shows that most Americans believed the myth was limited to what most white boys could do.
 It is impossible to establish clear genealogies for every president. This is the case with Harding. While some black advocates might take pride in finding a ‚Äúblack president,‚Äù if we have actually had any black presidents they assumed the office only by passing for white. Therefore, if Stewart‚Äôs claim was substantiated it might prove interesting to historians and biographers, but it would not change the fact that in 1920 Americans did not believe they were electing a black man or even a man of mixed racial ancestry. In 1920 Chancellor‚Äôs claims were seen as dangerous, even explosive, and he was fired from his job and had to flee the country as his book was suppressed by federal agents because of its content.
 Today, Harding is best known as a failed president who lacked the intellectual energy to be president and who succumbed to his desire for pleasures of the flesh. This is the aspect of Harding‚Äôs story that Francis Russell and other biographers found so compelling and that flowed from Russell‚Äôs reliance on Chancellor‚Äôs work. Russell implied that a link existed between Harding‚Äôs personal weaknesses of character that led him to fail as president, and his ‚Äúdark shadow.‚Äù Chancellor had explicitly made this argument with the assumption that weak character and blackness went hand in hand.
 In the end, it is better to examine what we can learn from the history of Harding‚Äôs era than it is to speculate about the race of one of his ancestors. Beyond the obvious irony of Americans embracing claims that were originally intended to destroy Harding‚Äôs political career, an additional irony is that the idea of the one drop rule once meant to ensure a clear definition of race now serves to undermine the idea of racial clarity.
 Clearly, America has not become the Promised Land, but it is a measure of the progress that America has made since the 1920s that part of Barack Obama‚Äôs appeal as a candidate is based upon the idea that he could become the first ‚Äúblack president,‚Äù and that he is not running away from this aspect of his identity. Some have charged that he is not ‚Äúblack enough‚Äù because he lacks the historical and cultural experiences of most American blacks. Unlike the debates that swirled, and continue to swirl, around Harding, Obama‚Äôs physical appearance and his personal biography make it clear that he is a black candidate even as he tries to transcend race. We should not consider Warren Harding to be the first black president. To do so would only diminish the importance of Americans knowingly electing a black person as president.

 Marsha L Stewart - 6/21/2008
 I am surprised that the comments left say that ""race is a social aspect."" In the US race has always been a physical concept. Harding's father was Black, so was his grandfather. His Black father was a first cousin to my Black G Grandmother. Social had nothing to do with it--family lineage is the key.
 Max J. Skidmore - 5/4/2008
 Well, in 1921 in Birmingham, Alabama, Harding did give a courageous speech--hard-hitting for the time and place--on racial justice.
 This isn't definitive evidence, but one may reasonably surmise that KKK members rarely did, or do, such things.
 James W Loewen - 4/28/2008
 Anyone who has been around much has met African Americans as light as me (and I'm of northern European descent) and European Americans much darker than Harding. Since one's race is socially defined, Harding was white. Arguing otherwise is essentialism. Sometimes it can be fun, even important, such as when taking on Jefferson's old biographers, who claimed that TJ COULD not have boinked Ms. Hemings because ""It was inconsistent with his character."" Then the biological racial admixture of their children plays a part.
 Question: there is some evidence that WGH participated in a KKK induction during his years in the White House. But the evidence is not compelling. What does this author (and his readers) think? \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 The Complexity of Race and the Presidency: A Historical Analysis
 
 Consider the legacy of Warren G. Harding's presidency in the context of 1920s America and the concept of the 'one-drop rule'.
 Analyze the role of William Estabrook Chancellor's accusations of Harding's racial ancestry in the 1920 presidential campaign, and evaluate the significance of Harding's response (or lack thereof) to these claims.
 Assess the author's argument that Harding should not be considered the first 'black president', despite some claims of African-American ancestry. Use historical context and the author's reasoning to support your position.

 Just to the southwest is the Platte River, whose valley was one of the great roadways to the west, used by fur traders, emigrants, military expeditions, gold seekers, and Mormons.
 Mormon migration to the Salt Lake Valley began at Winter Quarters, present-day Florence, in the spring of 1847. The Mormons crossed Big and Little Papillion creeks and the Elkhorn River, then continued along the north side of the Platte River to Fort Laramie in Wyoming. This route from the Missouri River, often referred to as the ""Mormon Trail,"" and later known as the ""Council Bluffs Road,"" follows present-day State Highway 36. It is estimated some 165,000 travelers used the route before the transcontinental railroad was finished in 1869.
 The Platte River appears on maps of North America dating to the eighteenth century. It is designated by different names including ""Panis"" based on the name Pawnee, ""La Platte"" (""The Flat"") as referred to by French fur traders, and ""Nebraska River,"" an Indian term meaning ""flat water.""

 Comparative Landscape Analysis
 
 Imagine you are an historical geographer tasked with mapping the Mormon Trail.
 Based on the provided text, describe in approximately 250-300 words how the landscape features of the Platte River Valley facilitated or hindered the Mormon migration in 1847.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 The Platte River Valley, with its relatively flat terrain, appears to have facilitated the Mormon migration in 1847 by providing a navigable route for travelers. The 'flat water' characteristic of the Platte River, as referred to by the Nebraska term, likely made it easier for the migrants to cross the river with their wagons and livestock. Additionally, the valley's gentle slopes would have allowed for a more straightforward journey, reducing the need for steep inclines and treacherous terrain. The presence of creeks, such as Big and Little Papillion, and the Elkhorn River, may have presented some challenges, but these water sources also would have provided essential water and potentially food sources for the migrants. However, one major drawback of the Platte River Valley would have been its attractiveness to other travelers and Native American tribes, potentially leading to conflicts over resources and territory. Furthermore, the flat terrain may have made it difficult for migrants to find suitable locations for settlements and defense, making them more vulnerable to attacks.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: 
 Your analysis of the Platte River Valley's landscape features as a facilitator of the Mormon migration in 1847 is thorough and well-supported by the text. You effectively highlight the valley's relatively flat terrain, gentle slopes, and navigable river crossings as advantages for the migrants.
 
 To further enhance your analysis, consider incorporating specific data or statistics from the text to support your claims. For instance, you could mention the estimated 165,000 travelers who used the route before the transcontinental railroad was finished in 1869, or the number of wagons and livestock that crossed the Platte River.
 Additionally, it would be beneficial to acknowledge potential drawbacks or limitations of the Platte River Valley's landscape. While the valley's flat terrain and navigable river crossings are advantages, you could also discuss the challenges posed by the presence of creeks, the need for suitable locations for settlements and defense, and the potential for conflicts over resources and territory.","### FEEDBACK: Comparative Landscape Analysis
 
 In your comparative landscape analysis of the Platte River Valley, you have provided a thorough and well-researched description of the region's landscape features and their impact on the Mormon migration in 1847.

 07-10-2012 (Dayton, OH) -
 A recent outbreak of E. Coli in Germantown, OH has led health officials to remind citizens to take caution when preparing and handling food. This is especially important during outdoor picnics in the high temperatures of the summer months which can intensify the bacteria in the food.
 ‚ÄúHuman infection of E.Coli is acquired through contaminated food or water or by direct contact with an infected person,‚Äù says Terrie Koss, infection preventionist at Dayton Children‚Äôs.
 Infections due to Escherichia coli bacteria can cause severe, bloody diarrhea. Some cases can result in kidney failure or other serious complications. Fortunately, most healthy kids who get the infection recover on their own without the need for treatment.
 ‚ÄúIf you suspect your child might have E.Coli you should consult their pediatrician or visit the Dayton Children‚Äôs urgent care or emergency department,‚Äù says Koss. ‚ÄúThe biggest concern is making sure the child stays hydrated.‚Äù
 The incubation period generally lasts anywhere from 10 hours to six days. An infection is contagious for at least as long as the person has diarrhea, and sometimes longer.
 A doctor might take a stool sample to detect the presence of E. coli bacteria. Blood tests may be used to check for possible complications.
 Antibiotics have not been found to be helpful in treating infections caused by E. coli O157:H7 and can, in fact, be harmful. Likewise, anti-diarrheal medicines can increase the risk of complications and should not be used.
 Kids with an E. coli infection should rest as much as possible and drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. Those who are dehydrated might need to be hospitalized to get IV fluids.
 ‚ÄúWhile recovering from an infection, kids can resume normal activities after two stool cultures are free of the bacteria‚Äù says Koss. ‚ÄúRefrain from letting kids use swimming pools or water slides until 2 weeks after their symptoms have gone away.‚Äù
 E. colioutbreaks have been related to a wide variety of foods, such as fresh spinach, hamburgers, ground beef, bologna, hazelnuts, packaged cheeses, shredded lettuce, and prepackaged cookie dough.
 Being vigilant about safe food preparation can go a long way toward protecting your family from E. coli infections:
 - Cook meat thoroughly until it reaches a temperature of at least 160¬∫F/70¬∫C at its thickest point.
 - Thoroughly clean anything that comes into contact with raw meat.
 - Choose pasteurized juices and dairy products.
 - Clean raw produce well before eating.
 Teach your kids the importance of regular, thorough hand washing, especially after going to the bathroom, touching animals, or playing outside, and before eating or preparing food. They should avoid swallowing water while swimming.
 When to Call the Doctor
 Call your doctor if your child has any symptoms of an E. coli infection, especially stomach pain or persistent, severe, or bloody diarrhea. Call immediately if your child shows signs of dehydration, such as decreased urination.

 An ancient Roman lead scroll unearthed in England three years ago has turned out to be a curse intended to cause misfortune to more than a dozen people, according to new research.
 Found in East Farleigh, U.K., in the filling of a 3rd to 4th Century AD building that may have originally been a temple, the scroll was made of a 2.3- by 3.9-inch inscribed lead tablet.
 Popular in the Greek and Roman world, these sorts of ""black magic"" curses called upon gods to torment specific victims.
 Rolled up to conceal their inscriptions, the tablets were either nailed to the wall of a temple or buried in places considered to be close to the underworld, such as graves, springs or wells.
 The scroll, unearthed in the Kent village had been carefully rolled up and buried, most likely in the third century AD, similar to other curse tablets found throughout Europe.
 The researchers tried to read the fragile scroll without unrolling it by using a technique called neutron computed tomography imaging at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, but ""the resolution was not sufficient to discern any writing on it,"" said the Maidstone Area Archaeological Group, which made the finding.
 As the curse tablet, or defixio, was unrolled, the inscribed letters became visible under a scanning electron microscope.
 Roger Tomlin, lecturer in late Roman history at Wolfson College, Oxford, and an authority on Roman inscriptions, was finally able to decode the inscribed text.
 ""The tablet is not necessarily complete, but what there is consists of two columns of personal names,"" Tomlin told Discovery News.
 He deciphered the Latin names Sacratus, Constitutus, Memorianus, Constant[...] and the Celtic names (Atr)ectus and Atidenus. Eight other names are incomplete.
 Interestingly, the scribe wrote a few of the names backward or upside down.
 Experts speculated that this was probably intended to invoke ""sympathetic magic"" and make life especially difficult for the named and shamed individuals.
 However, the motive of the curse and the curse itself remain a mystery.
 ""No god is named. Indeed, we cannot be sure that we have the beginning of the text,"" Tomlin said.
 Overall, more than 200 curse tablets have been found in Britain. The largest collection was found in the thermal spring at Bath, -- about 100 tablets -- and are displayed in the Roman Baths Museum.
 The second-largest collection is from the Roman temple at Uley, and some are displayed in the British Museum.
 Most curses related to thefts and called upon a god to fulfill the malevolent wishes detailed in the inscriptions.
 One of the tablets from Bath, for example, prayed that its victim should ""become as liquid as water,"" while another on display at the British Museum cursed ""Tretia Maria and her life and mind and memory and liver and lungs mixed up together, and her words, thoughts and memory.""
 According to the Maidstone Area archaeologists, it is reasonable to assume that the names listed were of people who lived at the site.
 ""Since the Romans were the first inhabitants of England who could read and write, they represent the earliest inhabitants of East Farleigh that we may ever be able to put a name to,"" they said.
 Further conservation work will be carried out on the scroll starting at the end of the month. Experts hope that this will result in more letters becoming visible.

 Ancient Curse Unveiled
 
 Imagine you are an archaeologist who has just discovered the unrolled curse tablet in the Kent village. Write a journal entry (approx. 150-200 words) describing the emotions and thoughts you experienced upon seeing the inscribed names and realizing the purpose of the ancient artifact.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 Today was a day I will not soon forget. As I unrolled the ancient curse tablet, I felt a mix of excitement and trepidation. The faded inscriptions on the lead surface slowly revealed the names of those who were intended to be tormented by the curse. I couldn't help but feel a sense of reverence for the people who lived in this village centuries ago, as well as a sense of unease knowing that these names represented real individuals who were the target of someone's malice. The names Sacratus, Constitutus, Memorianus, and others seemed to jump off the surface, transporting me to a time and place where such curses were not only plausible but also a reality. I couldn't help but wonder about the stories behind each name and the circumstances that led someone to seek such vengeful measures. It was a sobering reminder that, despite the passing of time, human nature remains a constant.

 Your journal entry effectively conveys the emotions and thoughts you experienced upon discovering the curse tablet. You've woven together a compelling narrative that explores the significance of the inscribed names and the historical context of the artifact. However, there are a few areas where you could improve clarity and concision.
 
 * In the first paragraph, consider rephrasing ""a mix of excitement and trepidation"" to something more descriptive, such as ""a sense of awe and foreboding.""
 * When describing the names, use more vivid language to help the reader visualize the scene. For example, instead of ""the names Sacratus, Constitutus, Memorianus, and others,"" you could say ""the faded names Sacratus, Constitutus, and Memorianus leapt off the surface, accompanied by the enigmatic (Atr)ectus and Atidenus.""
 * To enhance the narrative, consider adding more sensory details. What did the lead tablet feel like beneath your fingers? What did the air smell like as you unrolled the scroll?
 
 **Organization and Structure (4.5/5)**
 
 Your journal entry follows a clear chronological structure, which helps the reader follow your thought process. However, there are a few moments where the transition between ideas feels a bit abrupt. To improve the flow, consider adding transitional phrases or sentences to connect your thoughts.
 
 * For example, after describing the emotions you felt, you could say something like, ""As I delved deeper into the names, I began to wonder about the stories behind each one.""
 * When discussing the historical context, consider providing more context or background information to help the reader understand the significance of the curse tablets.
 
 **Style and Tone (4.5/5)**
 
 Your writing has a clear, engaging tone that draws the reader into the story. However, there are a few moments where the language feels a bit generic or cliche. To improve the style, consider using more descriptive language and varied sentence structures.
 
 * For example, instead of saying ""the tablet serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities and mysteries of human history,"" you could say ""the curse tablet stands as a haunting testament to the darker corners of human experience.""
 * When using metaphors or similes, make sure they add depth and insight to the narrative. In this case, the comparison of the names to ""leaping off the surface"" is a good start, but consider adding more context or explanation to make it more effective.
 
 **Mechanics and Conventions (4.5/5)**
 
 Your writing is generally free of grammatical errors, but there are a few areas where you could improve clarity and precision.
 
 * For example, in the sentence ""I couldn't help but wonder about the stories behind each name and the circumstances that led someone to seek such vengeful measures,"" consider rephrasing it to ""I found myself pondering the stories behind each name and the motivations behind the curse.""
 * When using quotes or direct speech, make sure to format them correctly and provide proper attribution.

 33. Difference between Lenses and Filters
 May 13, 2015
 Lenses and Filters are investigative tools of enquiry and domain analysis allowing the discovery of concepts and relations. The difference between (BIM) Lenses and Filters can be summarised as such: Lenses are additive and are deployed from the ‚Äòinvestigator‚Äôs side‚Äô of BIM Field observation while Filters are subtractive and are deployed from the ‚Äòdata side‚Äô. Lenses highlight observables that meet research criteria and identify their relations; example, an infrared lens highlights heat sources in a scene. Filters remove observables that do not meet the research criteria; example, data filters hides non-conforming data within a spreadsheet. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 In a research project employing Building Information Modelling (BIM) to analyze energy efficiency in buildings, you need to identify areas with high heat loss.
 
 Explain how you would utilize a Lens and a Filter in your BIM analysis to achieve your research goal, providing a specific example for each tool and highlighting their distinct outputs.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 To identify areas with high heat loss, I would utilize a Lens to highlight areas with high heat loss by deploying a thermal lens that visualizes temperature differences across the building structure, for example, it could reveal areas around windows or doors where heat is escaping. On the other hand, I would use a Filter to remove data that is not relevant to heat loss, such as data on room usage or lighting, thereby isolating the specific data on heat loss and facilitating my analysis.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX

 The Lead in a Song Bird
 There are dangers for people who work with lead. There are also dangers for birds who live near lead. About half of ground-feeding songbirds collected from a historic lead mining district in southeast Missouri contained toxic levels of lead in their blood and internal organs, according to a new U.S. Geological Survey study. Elevated lead levels were also found in soils and earthworms in the lead district sites examined, which included the ""Missouri Mines""in the Old Lead Belt; ""Washington State Park,"" on the Big River floodplain; and the ""Viburnum Trend,"" within Mark Twain National Forest. Tested birds had lead concentrations exceeding those of reference birds by factors of 8 in blood, 13 in liver, and 23 in kidney samples. Soils in the study exceeded background levels for lead nearly 40 fold, for zinc 8 fold, and for cadmium 25 fold.
 Southeast Missouri contains the world's largest deposit of the lead mineral galena. The area has a long history of lead mining and smelting. Lead has been mined in the region since 1721. Previous studies have measured elevated lead in floodplain soils, stream sediments, fish, invertebrates, amphibians, other birds and wildlife in the area. Lead has been released from the erosion of tailings, mine waste, smelting, and dust. Periodic flooding has also transported lead in the environment.
 The Southeast Missouri Lead District, commonly called the Lead Belt, is a lead mining district in the southeastern part of Missouri. Counties in the Lead Belt include Saint Francois; Crawford; Dent; Iron; Madison: Reynolds; and Washington. The town of Sainte Genevieve was founded as a river port for transportation of lead out of the area. Moses Austin started large-scale mining and smelting, at Potosi, originally known as Mine a Breton, and founded Herculaneum as his shipping point on the Mississippi. This lead was originally used as a roofing material. Bonne Terre has large subterranean mines, now used commercially for recreational scuba diving.
 The area of mining has changed over the years. The Old Lead Belt is centered around Park Hills and Desloge, while the New Lead Belt or Viburnum Trend is near Viburnum. The Irish Wilderness in Ripley and Oregon Counties has significant lead ore; however, this is a protected wilderness area.
 Cadmium levels in birds from the mining study sites were also several times those in reference birds, but concentrations of zinc were not elevated more than those in the reference birds.
 Ground-feeding songbirds were selected for the study because they were more likely to be exposed to lead than songbirds feeding in shrubs or in the forest canopy. Cardinals, robins, blue jays, and eastern towhees were among the birds tested.
 USGS completed this study at the request of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service as part of a natural resource damage assessment by the U.S. Department of the Interior to investigate whether wildlife might be adversely affected by exposure to lead contaminated soil.
 Lead poisoning in birds can cause abnormal muscular function, kidney and liver failure, decreased fertility, and anemia. Songbirds poisoned by lead, however, generally do not show lesions. The exposure to lead is detected by chemically testing tissues or by measuring suppressed enzyme levels.
 Lead is a highly poisonous metal (regardless if inhaled or swallowed), affecting almost every organ and system in the body. The main target for lead toxicity is the nervous system, both in adults and children.
 The study, ""Toxic exposure of songbirds to lead in the Southeast Missouri Lead Mining District,"" is available in the journal Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology.

"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
 Monovision is a method of treatment used for patients who have developed a condition called presbyopia. Presbyopia usually starts to develop when people reach the age of 40-45. It causes uncontrollable change to eyesight and usually results in problems with reading and focusing on objects that are close by. Most cases of presbyopia can be aided with glasses and contact lenses; however, a method called monovision may also be helpful. Monovision involves fitting one eye with a distance lens and one eye with a close-up lens, which enables people to see clearly at distance and up-close.
 Presbyopia is a condition which affects the ability of the eyes to switch between focusing on far and near objects, therefore making it difficult to see objects close-up. Presbyopia usually develops around the age of 40 and eventually everyone will develop the condition. Presbyopia is sometimes known as ‚Äòshort-arm syndrome‚Äô and the main symptom is difficulty focusing on things that are close to you, which means you may have difficulty reading small print on a computer screen, in a book or on a medicine bottle, for example.
 How does monovision work?
 Monovision may seem like an odd concept, but it can be very effective. Monovision works by essentially tricking the eye into thinking that the contact lens is part of the natural eye. Each one of us has a dominant and non-dominant eye. A contact lens for distance viewing is placed in the dominant eye and a contact lens for near viewing is placed in the non-dominant eye.
 It is also possible to have monovision laser treatment (a method called monovision LASIK), which uses the same concept but there is no need for contact lenses. One eye is corrected for distance viewing and one eye is corrected for nearby viewing. For those who are not sure whether they want to commit to surgery, it is advisable to try monovision with contact lenses first and see how you get on. Before you have surgery you will be examined by an ophthalmologist to check that monovision is a suitable treatment for you. The risks of the procedure, which tend to be very low, will also be explained.
 Adjusting to monovision
 It can take a short while to become accustomed to Monovision, but after a while most people are unaware that they are wearing different types of contact lenses and they experience a significant improvement in their sight.
 Monovision is not a suitable treatment for everyone, though it does appear to be effective for many people with presbyopia. Monovision will not give you perfect vision, but it can help to make your vision considerably better. There may be a slight loss of focus between distance and close viewing, so monovision may not be suitable for patients who require optimum levels of correction. Your optometrist or ophthalmologist will be able to tell you whether you are a suitable candidate for monovision treatment. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

 All organisms contain protein but the protein content of organisms varies. In general, foods of animal origin have a greater protein content than plants and plant-derived foods. This is largely due to the skeletal muscle of animals or protein requirements before (e.g., egg) or after birth (e.g., milk). The protein content of skeletal muscle or animal flesh is approximately 22%. Water-packed tuna derives more than 80% of its energy from protein. Approximately 65% of the protein that Americans eat is derived from animal sources. In comparison, many African and Asian societies derive only about 20% of their protein from animals.
 Below is a general overview of different types of proteins and their protein content based on portion size:
 Animal meat proteins are very similar to human skeletal muscle proteins and include myosin, actin, troponins, and other proteins. Typically, animal meat is more than 80% protein on a dry weight basis. In addition to protein, meats deliver iron, selenium, and vitamin B12. Meats are among the best food sources of creatine, carnosine, and beta-alanine. However, meats are often a contributor of fat to the diet. Chicken tends to store more fat beneath the skin (subcutaneously) whereas cows have adipose tissue marbled throughout their muscle tissue, which is visually obvious. Removing the skin of a chicken breast or thigh would greatly lower the fat content and increase the protein content (as a percent of total energy). Beef can be trimmed of visible fat to lower its fat content. However, fat in food provides flavoring.
 Fish proteins are very similar to mammalian meat proteins with a few striking differences. For instance, microscopically, the striated appearance of fish myo- fibrils is similar to mammals and contains the same proteins. However the skeletal muscle of fish is organized with shorter fibers and arranged between connective tissue sheets. Fish is generally a lean protein source containing relatively little fat. For instance, water-packed tuna derives more than 80% of its energy from protein. While being a leaner protein option is true for many fish, consumers need to check the food label, as some fish are fatty or perhaps canned in oils which can increase the non-protein calories of a fish source.
 Milk proteins include casein and serum proteins or whey. Casein proteins account for roughly 78% of milk‚Äôs nitrogen-based mass and whey is 17%. The remaining nitrogen compounds found in milk are mostly amino acids and peptides. Casein is a family of spherical phosphoproteins while whey consists largely of b-lactoglobulin, lactalbumin, immunoglobulins, and other albumins. The most abundant whey protein is b-lactoglobulin, which is rich in the amino acids lysine, leucine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid while the immunoglobulins are largely immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA, and IgG. Whey and casein proteins are among the most common proteins in protein supplements with sourcing as whey protein concentrate (WPC; 80% protein dry weight) and whey protein isolate (WPI; 90% protein dry weight). Whey tends to be digested and absorbed faster than other proteins, including slower digesting casein proteins. The main difference is that whey is more acid stable than casein, which results in whey moving from the stomach to the small intestine quickly while casein forms a gel and slows the transit time dramatically.
 There are at least eight main proteins in egg whites, including ovalbumin, conalbumin, ovomucoid, avidin, flavoprotein-apoprotein, ‚Äúproteinase inhibitor,‚Äù ovomucin, and globulins. Protein collectively accounts for about 11‚Äì12% of liquid egg white. Meanwhile, much of the egg yolk proteins are found in the form of emulsifying lipoproteins due to the high lipid content of the yolk. Egg yolk is rich in fat and consequently egg white has higher protein concentration (gram for gram) than a whole egg or the yolk. To highlight the difference, a whole egg will have 6 g protein (24 kcals) and about 75 kcals total, so a whole egg is roughly 33% protein while at the same time, one egg white will have 3‚Äì4 grams of protein, which accounts for > 90% of its 15‚Äì16 kcals.
 The four main protein fractions in wheat are albumin, globulin, gliadin, and glutenin. When gliadin and glutenin, as part of flour, are mixed with water, they form gluten, which provides the structural network that allows bread to rise. Gluten proteins are rich in glutamine and relatively low in lysine, methionine, and tryptophan. Gluten-free products have appeared on the market in high amounts during the last decade. Some individuals have a sensitivity and/or allergic reaction to gluten in the intestine that results in diarrhea and malabsorption issues (gluten-sensitive enteropathy). Whether gluten is responsible for other health conditions is debatable and controversial.
 Soy proteins are complex multiprotein globulins in general and soy protein is a good source of all essential amino acids except methionine and tryptophan. Soy protein isolate (SPI) is used commercially in drinks mixed with fruit and water, coffee whiteners, liquid whipped toppings, and sour cream dressings. Soy proteins are often found associated with isoflavone molecules, such as genestein and daidzein, which might have health-promoting properties and are considered nutraceuticals (Soy protein isolate is used in some protein supplements and is a more cost effective protein ingredient than WPI.

 Your answer will be evaluated on the basis of the depth of your analysis, accuracy of the information provided, and overall coherence of your argument.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 This critical evaluation will focus on whey protein, an animal-derived protein source, and soy protein, a plant-based protein source. Whey protein, found in milk, is a fast-digesting protein with a high protein content of 90% in its isolate form (WPI). It contains all essential amino acids, with a high concentration of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), including leucine, isoleucine, and valine. However, whey protein has been associated with potential digestive issues, such as bloating and gas, in some individuals. On the other hand, soy protein is a plant-based protein source that is a good source of all essential amino acids, except for methionine and tryptophan. Soy protein isolate (SPI) has a protein content of approximately 90% and is often used in food products and protein supplements. However, soy protein has been linked to potential thyroid problems due to its isoflavone content. Additionally, soy protein has been criticized for its potential environmental impact, as large-scale soybean farming has been linked to deforestation and habitat destruction.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Assignment Submission

 CORE COMPETENCIES AND DOMAINS OF LEARNING
 The knowledge base of the Vocational Rehabilitation profession is divided into a number of domains which reflect major areas of knowledge. These domains were constructed by examining the field and other similar professional designations (e.g., CCRC, CDMP, RRP, etc.).
 1. Vocational Rehabilitation Theory and Practice:
 This is a fairly large and complex domain in that it contains the foundational information of the profession. It includes such topics as: history of vocational rehabilitation profession, models of vocational rehabilitation, the value of vocational rehabilitation (e.g., why do it), legal foundation, other professions which provide services to vocational rehabilitation professionals, legal implications (e.g., expert witness), etc.
 2. Aspects of Disabilities:
 The VR professional needs to have a clear understanding of the wide range of disabilities and their implications: work related injuries / illness, non-work related injuries / illnesses, congenital disabilities, physical disabilities, psychological disabilities, preventative approaches, trends in disabilities (e.g.. rise of psychological disabilities), etc.
 3. Vocational Interviewing and Counselling:
 Typically, this is the first step in the VR process and every professional should have skills in these areas. This domain examines the techniques and implications of vocational interviewing: what information is important, how is trust built, what should be documented, how to elicit information, etc. The professional also needs a solid understanding of vocational counselling techniques including: understanding the end-goal, understanding the client needs / goals, working with the difficult client, moving the client forward, cross-cultural / gender implications, development of return to work plan, etc.
 Not all VR professionals will undertake assessments of clients but everyone needs to have a clear understanding of their uses and implications. There should be an understanding of: when assessments are used, the types of assessments which can be used (e.g., aptitude, interest, achievement), what the various assessments test, how to read and understand an assessment, defining the questions to be asked of the assessor, transferable skills analysis, using computer software programs, statistics (e.g., standard deviation, mean, median, mode, etc.), etc.
 One of the major directions within all professions over the past number of years is the understanding of the diversity of clients. This domain examines the various diverse groups (e.g., gender, cultural, racial, sexual orientation, etc.) and the implications for the VR process. VR professionals should understand: how to identify one‚Äôs own biases, working with diverse groups, using community / family resources, understanding the implications of diversity on return to work, etc.
 6. Job Development and Placement:
 Getting individuals with disability characteristics into or back into the workforce is one of the main tenets of the VR profession and this domain is at the heart of what many professionals undertake on an ongoing basis. This domain examines: understanding limitations / restrictions, understanding job demands, hidden job market, resume construction, interview skills, locating a job placement, job club, job coaching, co-worker model, monitoring, job development, etc.
 7. Case / Disability Management:
 This domain covers two fairly broad areas: case management and disability management. In Case Management, professionals need to have an understanding of: working with the medical community, working with insurance carriers (including the compensation system), using community resources, referrals to additional resources, the rehabilitation process, rehabilitation professionals, etc. Disability Management covers such areas as: early contact, early intervention, working with management / labour groups, job accommodation, job modification, work related restrictions / limitations, graduated return to work, etc
 8. Ethical and Professional Conduct:
 This domain examines the ethical foundation for professionals‚Äô work. This would include: determining ethical dilemmas, understanding conflicting values, examining possible decisions and their short / long term implications, codes of ethics, legal responsibilities, etc. In addition, this domain covers the VR professional‚Äôs well-being (e.g., burn out, relaxation, healthy life-style, etc.)
 9. Communication and Record Keeping:
 This domain examines: keeping accurate records, what should / should not be documented, communication with other professionals, file and document security, speaking to a group, use of computer programs (such as word processor, PowerPoint, Excel), adult learning, release of information, etc.

"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
 It‚Äôs one of those thoughts that hit you as you‚Äôre showering in the morning: why exactly do we use glass for windows? Why not plastic or some other material?
 It‚Äôs a pretty interesting idea. Glass is something we associate as being very fragile. Windows are supposed to offer some degree of protection, but fragile and safety don‚Äôt exactly go hand-in-hand. Plus, in an earthquake or a storm, shattered glass could injure or even kill someone. It certainly wouldn‚Äôt be hard to cut yourself with it. Glass is also difficult to transport, as it can easily crack while it‚Äôs moving from factory to destination.
 So why do we, a society that is always looking for the best and the most convenient, still use something as impractical as glass?
 There are a couple of interesting reasons. First of all, even though glass can shatter, it‚Äôs stronger than you think. Plus, there really is no in-between for glass: it‚Äôs either in good condition or it‚Äôs broken. Sure, it can get slightly damaged or cracked but that is more of an inconvenience than a serious issue, and it‚Äôs very easy to spot. A material like plastic could easily get warped or wear down and you would have no idea. It could be potentially useless, and since there‚Äôs no way of you knowing, you wouldn‚Äôt know to replace it.
 Another reason is because glass is a very hard material. Plastic and other materials just simply can‚Äôt compare to it. It‚Äôs not hard to scratch plastic. Glass, on the other hand, holds up against dirt, sand, and other material that gets thrown at it. Sure, if you threw a baseball directly at it, the glass will shatter whereas the plastic would be okay. But if there was a storm and the wind was kicking up small rocks or other material, the glass would probably come out untouched whereas the plastic would have noticeable wear.
 Glass is also sturdy while still being thin. If you tried to make a thin piece of plastic and stand it up, it will probably fold over. Glass, on the other hand, doesn‚Äôt bend at all. It‚Äôs a solid material that remains stiff and sturdy. A plastic window would need to be significantly thicker to make it that stiff, and that thickness would affect the overall quality of the window and probably not look as good.
 An important part of having windows is that it helps you with your energy conservation. If you don‚Äôt know how windows affect your energy bills, check out some of our other posts about the importance of having energy efficient windows. Basically, windows are essential for insulation, especially double-paned windows. Plastic doesn‚Äôt exactly have the same insulating properties and would therefore not work as well.
 Finally, the ability of glass to break can actually be a good thing. If you were stuck in a house during a fire and needed to get out, it would be really tough to break a plastic window. But, all it would take is a chair or a heavy object to shatter the glass window allowing you to get out.
 So, as you can see, it‚Äôs perfectly reasonable and even preferable for us to use glass for our windows. However, not all glass is the same. Arch City Window chooses to use ultra-high quality glass so that you get the optimum comfort and function. Our low-e glass uses a transparent coating that drastically increases your efficiency. If you‚Äôre interested in getting new windows or want more information about just how good our glass is, head over to archcitywindow.com! \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Analyze and compare the structural and functional properties of three different materials (glass, acrylic, and polycarbonate) for window applications.
 
 Consider the thermal insulation and optical clarity of the three materials.
 Examine and compare the durability, scratch resistance, and maintenance needs of the three materials.
 think of potential alternatives for the three given materials, considering any specialty window applications, like specialty glass, high-security windows and windows for extreme weather conditions.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 For window applications, glass, acrylic, and polycarbonate have different structural and functional properties. Thermal insulation and optical clarity are crucial factors. Glass has high optical clarity, but its thermal insulation varies depending on the type. Acrylic has lower optical clarity and variable thermal insulation, while polycarbonate has lower optical clarity and higher thermal insulation than glass. Durability-wise, glass is prone to shattering, but has high scratch resistance and low maintenance needs. Acrylic is less prone to shattering than glass, but more prone than polycarbonate. However, acrylic has lower scratch resistance than glass and higher maintenance needs. Polycarbonate is highly resistant to shattering, but has lower scratch resistance and higher maintenance needs than glass. For specialty window applications, aluminum oxynitrides, thin film ceramic, and polymer-coated glass are notable alternatives. Also considering high-security windows, laminated glass and metal-reinforced polymers could be used. For extreme weather conditions, weather-resistant acrylic and high-impact polycarbonate are potential alternatives.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Assignment Analysis and Comparison
 
 Your analysis and comparison of glass, acrylic, and polycarbonate for window applications is thorough and well-structured. You have effectively considered the thermal insulation and optical clarity of the three materials, as well as their durability, scratch resistance, and maintenance needs.
 
 However, there are a few areas for improvement:
 
 * In the comparison of thermal insulation, you could have provided more specific details about the thermal performance of each material under various conditions.
 * When discussing durability, you could have explored the impact of environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity, on the longevity of each material.
 * To strengthen your argument, consider incorporating more data and research to support your claims about the performance of each material.
 
 Overall, your analysis provides a solid foundation for understanding the structural and functional properties of glass, acrylic, and polycarbonate for window applications.","### FEEDBACK: Your analysis of the structural and functional properties of glass, acrylic, and polycarbonate for window applications is thorough, but there are a few areas that need improvement.

 COVID-19 exacerbated preexisting resentment against racial/ethnic minorities and marginalized communities, according to a government study conducted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the nation‚Äôs medical research agency. Furthermore, the taxpayer-funded probe reveals that in comparison with whites all minorities ‚Äúwere more likely to report that people acted afraid of them because of suspected COVID-19 infection.‚Äù Limited English proficiency, less than a high school education and an annual income below $60,000 were also associated with experiencing increased discrimination, the study found.
 Scientists from the NIH‚Äôs National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities used a special tool called Unequal Racial Burden (CURB) survey to conduct the analysis. The data was used to measure the prevalence of COVID-19-related discrimination in all major racial and ethnic groups in the United States. The government scientists also analyzed the impact of other social and demographic factors on pandemic-related discrimination and found that people from marginalized groups, such as those who speak little to no English and those with lower education levels, were also found to face more discrimination. ‚ÄúTo the best of our knowledge, this is the largest, most racially diverse, and most recent assessment of COVID-19‚Äìrelated discrimination in the United States,‚Äù the researchers write in their recently published paper.
 Information was collected by the online CURB survey in English and Spanish from 5,500 American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Black/African American, Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, Latino, white, and multiracial adults. The survey asked whether participants had experienced COVID-19‚Äìrelated discriminatory behaviors, such as being called names or insulted, being threatened or harassed, or hearing racist comments, because the perpetrator thought the participant had COVID-19. The survey also asked whether participants felt that others acted afraid of them because they belonged to a racial/ethnic group misconceived to get COVID-19 more often.
 More than 42% of the minority responders reported that ‚Äúpeople acted afraid of them,‚Äù and 22% said they had experienced ‚ÄúCOVD-19-related discriminatory behaviors.‚Äù All racial and ethnic minority groups are more likely to experience COVID-related discrimination compared to whites, the racial burden surveys reveal. ‚ÄúParticipants who identified as Asian or American Indian/Alaska Native were most likely to have experienced this hostile behavior, and participants who identified as Hawaiian or Pacific Islander or Latino were also highly likely to have experienced discrimination,‚Äù the findings state. ‚ÄúHigher rates of discrimination affected participants who lived in a big city; in a rural area; or in Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, or Tennessee.‚Äù
 In an announcement promoting the study last week the NIH writes that the results suggest COVID-19 has worsened existing resentment toward racial and ethnic minorities and ‚Äúother minority populations‚Äù in the United States. ‚ÄúThe study showcases the need for careful and responsible public health messaging during public health crises to help prevent and address discrimination against groups that have been marginalized,‚Äù the agency writes. In the paper the researchers state that ‚Äúefforts are needed to minimize and discredit racially driven language and discrimination around COVID-19 and future epidemics.‚Äù They also assert that future studies and public health efforts focused on COVID-related discrimination ‚Äúshould explicitly include all major racial/ethnic groups, as most appear to be at equally high risk as Asian adults but have thus far been largely ignored in antidiscrimination efforts.‚Äù

For example, the survey was administered online and minorities with limited or no internet access were less likely to be included.

 Statement of Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., Director, NIAID, NIH, on National HIV Testing Day, June 27, 2010
 June 25, 2010
 Routine HIV testing is central to ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In the United States, someone becomes infected with HIV every nine and a half minutes. More than 20 percent of the estimated 1.1 million Americans living with HIV infection do not know they are infected.
 On National HIV Testing Day, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, urges everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 years to be tested for HIV at least once in their lifetime in keeping with the recommendation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). People at high risk for HIV infection -- including substance abusers and their sexual partners, gay and bisexual men, female partners of bisexual men, and individuals with multiple sex partners -- should get tested at least once a year.
 Knowing one's HIV status is vitally important to the individual and for protecting the broader public health. Testing positive for HIV infection is the critical first step linking a person to counseling, medical care and treatment, which help improve quality of health and stave off HIV-related complications and co-infections. People who know they are infected with HIV also are more likely to reduce behaviors that could transmit the virus to others, which benefits the larger community.
 Additionally, a growing body of evidence suggests that people infected with HIV who consistently take antiretroviral therapy to control the virus not only protect their health but may be less infectious to others -- a theory NIAID is currently examining through clinical research.
 Later this year, in collaboration with CDC and local health departments, NIAID will launch a feasibility study in several U.S. cities, designed to determine whether expanded HIV testing along with better linkages to medical care and treatment can show value as part of a broader campaign to reduce HIV incidence.
 Although expanded HIV testing initiatives and prevention efforts appear to be having some positive impact, far too many people still are getting infected with HIV. Nearly three decades into the HIV/AIDS epidemic, more than 56,000 new HIV infections occur each year, an unacceptably high rate that has remained relatively stable since the late 1990s.
 HIV infection may not grab the headlines as it did during the darkest days in the 1980s, but it is still a serious, incurable medical issue that can lead to AIDS -- a disease that claimed nearly 18,000 American lives in 2007. Too many people are diagnosed with HIV late in the course of infection, missing the window of opportunity when antiretroviral therapy can provide the best health outcomes.
 Sadly, the stigma and fear associated with HIV testing are still very real concerns for many. On this National HIV Testing Day, we all must do our part to eliminate these obstacles and emphasize the important, lifesaving value of getting tested. To find an HIV testing site near you or for more information about HIV testing, visit AIDSinfo and AIDS.gov.

 Partitioning enhances the performance, manageability, and availability of a wide variety of applications and helps reduce the total cost of ownership for storing large amounts of data. Partitioning allows tables, indexes, and index-organized tables to be subdivided into smaller pieces, enabling these database objects to be managed and accessed at a finer level of granularity. Oracle provides a rich variety of partitioning strategies and extensions to address every business requirement. Moreover, since it is entirely transparent, partitioning can be applied to almost any application without the need for potentially expensive and time consuming application changes.
 This chapter contains the following topics:
 Partitioning allows a table, index, or index-organized table to be subdivided into smaller pieces, where each piece of such a database object is called a partition. Each partition has its own name, and may optionally have its own storage characteristics.
 From the perspective of a database administrator, a partitioned object has multiple pieces that can be managed either collectively or individually. This gives the administrator considerable flexibility in managing partitioned objects. However, from the perspective of the application, a partitioned table is identical to a non-partitioned table; no modifications are necessary when accessing a partitioned table using SQL queries and DML statements.
 Figure 2-1 offers a graphical view of how partitioned tables differ from non-partitioned tables.
 Note:All partitions of a partitioned object must reside in tablespaces of a single block size.
 See Also:Oracle Database Concepts for more information about multiple block sizes
 Each row in a partitioned table is unambiguously assigned to a single partition. The partitioning key is comprised of one or more columns that determine the partition where each row will be stored. Oracle automatically directs insert, update, and delete operations to the appropriate partition through the use of the partitioning key.
 Any table can be partitioned into a million separate partitions except those tables containing columns with
 RAW datatypes. You can, however, use tables containing columns with
 Note:To reduce disk usage and memory usage (specifically, the buffer cache), you can store tables and partitions of a partitioned table in a compressed format inside the database. This often leads to a better scaleup for read-only operations. Table compression can also speed up query execution. There is, however, a slight cost in CPU overhead.
 See Also:Oracle Database Concepts for more information about table compression
 Here are some suggestions for when to partition a table:
 Tables greater than 2 GB should always be considered as candidates for partitioning.
 Tables containing historical data, in which new data is added into the newest partition. A typical example is a historical table where only the current month's data is updatable and the other 11 months are read only.
 When the contents of a table need to be distributed across different types of storage devices.
 Here are some suggestions for when to consider partitioning an index:
 Avoid rebuilding the entire index when data is removed.
 Perform maintenance on parts of the data without invalidating the entire index.
 Reduce the impact of index skew caused by an index on a column with a monotonically increasing value.
 Partitioned index-organized tables are very useful for providing improved performance, manageability, and availability for index-organized tables.
 For partitioning an index-organized table:
 Partition columns must be a subset of the primary key columns
 Secondary indexes can be partitioned (both locally and globally)
 OVERFLOW data segments are always equi-partitioned with the table partitions
 See Also:Oracle Database Concepts for more information about index-organized tables
 System partitioning enables application-controlled partitioning without having the database controlling the data placement. The database simply provides the ability to break down a table into partitions without knowing what the individual partitions are going to be used for. All aspects of partitioning have to be controlled by the application. For example, an insertion into a system partitioned table without the explicit specification of a partition will fail.
 System partitioning provides the well-known benefits of partitioning (scalability, availability, and manageability), but the partitioning and actual data placement are controlled by the application.
 See Also:Oracle Database Data Cartridge Developer's Guide for more information about system partitioning
 Information Lifecycle Management (ILM) is concerned with managing data during its lifetime. Partitioning plays a key role in ILM because it enables groups of data (that is, partitions) to be distributed across different types of storage devices and managed individually.
 See Also:Chapter 5, ""Using Partitioning for Information Lifecycle Management"" for more information about Information Lifecycle Management
 Unstructured data (such as images and documents) which is stored in a LOB column in the database can also be partitioned. When a table is partitioned, all the columns will reside in the tablespace for that partition, with the exception of LOB columns, which can be stored in their own tablespace.
 This technique is very useful when a table is comprised of large LOBs because they can be stored separately from the main data. This can be beneficial if the main data is being frequently updated but the LOB data isn't. For example, an employee record may contain a photo which is unlikely to change frequently. However, the employee personnel details (such as address, department, manager, and so on) could change. This approach also means that cheaper storage can be used for storing the LOB data and more expensive, faster storage used for the employee record.
 Partitioning can provide tremendous benefit to a wide variety of applications by improving performance, manageability, and availability. It is not unusual for partitioning to improve the performance of certain queries or maintenance operations by an order of magnitude. Moreover, partitioning can greatly simplify common administration tasks.
 Partitioning also enables database designers and administrators to tackle some of the toughest problems posed by cutting-edge applications. Partitioning is a key tool for building multi-terabyte systems or systems with extremely high availability requirements.
 By limiting the amount of data to be examined or operated on, and by providing data distribution for parallel execution, partitioning provides a number of performance benefits. These features include:
 Partition pruning is the simplest and also the most substantial means to improve performance using partitioning. Partition pruning can often improve query performance by several orders of magnitude. For example, suppose an application contains an
 Orders table containing a historical record of orders, and that this table has been partitioned by week. A query requesting orders for a single week would only access a single partition of the
 Orders table. If the
 Orders table had 2 years of historical data, then this query would access one partition instead of 104 partitions. This query could potentially execute 100 times faster simply because of partition pruning.
 Partition pruning works with all of Oracle's other performance features. Oracle will utilize partition pruning in conjunction with any indexing technique, join technique, or parallel access method.
 Partitioning can also improve the performance of multi-table joins by using a technique known as partition-wise joins. Partition-wise joins can be applied when two tables are being joined together and both tables are partitioned on the join key, or when a reference partitioned table is joined with its parent table. Partition-wise joins break a large join into smaller joins that occur between each of the partitions, completing the overall join in less time. This offers significant performance benefits both for serial and parallel execution.
 Partitioning allows tables and indexes to be partitioned into smaller, more manageable units, providing database administrators with the ability to pursue a ""divide and conquer"" approach to data management. With partitioning, maintenance operations can be focused on particular portions of tables. For example, a database administrator could back up a single partition of a table, rather than backing up the entire table. For maintenance operations across an entire database object, it is possible to perform these operations on a per-partition basis, thus dividing the maintenance process into more manageable chunks.
 A typical usage of partitioning for manageability is to support a ""rolling window"" load process in a data warehouse. Suppose that a DBA loads new data into a table on a weekly basis. That table could be partitioned so that each partition contains one week of data. The load process is simply the addition of a new partition using a partition exchange load. Adding a single partition is much more efficient than modifying the entire table, since the DBA does not need to modify any other partitions.
 Partitioned database objects provide partition independence. This characteristic of partition independence can be an important part of a high-availability strategy. For example, if one partition of a partitioned table is unavailable, then all of the other partitions of the table remain online and available. The application can continue to execute queries and transactions against the available partitions for the table, and these database operations will run successfully, provided they do not need to access the unavailable partition.
 The database administrator can specify that each partition be stored in a separate tablespace; the most common scenario is having these tablespaces stored on different storage tiers. Storing different partitions in different tablespaces allows the database administrator to do backup and recovery operations on each individual partition, independent of the other partitions in the table. Thus allowing the active parts of the database to be made available sooner so access to the system can continue, while the inactive data is still being restored. Moreover, partitioning can reduce scheduled downtime. The performance gains provided by partitioning may enable database administrators to complete maintenance operations on large database objects in relatively small batch windows.
 Oracle Partitioning offers three fundamental data distribution methods as basic partitioning strategies that control how data is placed into individual partitions:
 Using these data distribution methods, a table can either be partitioned as a single list or as a composite partitioned table:
 Each partitioning strategy has different advantages and design considerations. Thus, each strategy is more appropriate for a particular situation.
 A table is defined by specifying one of the following data distribution methodologies, using one or more columns as the partitioning key:
 For example, consider a table with a column of type
 NUMBER as the partitioning key and two partitions
 less_than_one_thousand partition contains rows where the following condition is true:
 500 <= partitioning key < 1000
 Figure 2-2 offers a graphical view of the basic partitioning strategies for a single-level partitioned table.
 Range partitioning maps data to partitions based on ranges of values of the partitioning key that you establish for each partition. It is the most common type of partitioning and is often used with dates. For a table with a date column as the partitioning key, the
 January-2005 partition would contain rows with partitioning key values from 01-Jan-2005 to 31-Jan-2005.
 Each partition has a
 THAN clause, which specifies a non-inclusive upper bound for the partitions. Any values of the partitioning key equal to or higher than this literal are added to the next higher partition. All partitions, except the first, have an implicit lower bound specified by the
 THAN clause of the previous partition.
 MAXVALUE literal can be defined for the highest partition.
 MAXVALUE represents a virtual infinite value that sorts higher than any other possible value for the partitioning key, including the NULL value.
 Hash partitioning maps data to partitions based on a hashing algorithm that Oracle applies to the partitioning key that you identify. The hashing algorithm evenly distributes rows among partitions, giving partitions approximately the same size.
 Hash partitioning is the ideal method for distributing data evenly across devices. Hash partitioning is also an easy-to-use alternative to range partitioning, especially when the data to be partitioned is not historical or has no obvious partitioning key.
 Note:You cannot change the hashing algorithms used by partitioning.
 List partitioning enables you to explicitly control how rows map to partitions by specifying a list of discrete values for the partitioning key in the description for each partition. The advantage of list partitioning is that you can group and organize unordered and unrelated sets of data in a natural way. For a table with a region column as the partitioning key, the
 North America partition might contain values
 DEFAULT partition enables you to avoid specifying all possible values for a list-partitioned table by using a default partition, so that all rows that do not map to any other partition do not generate an error.
 Composite partitioning is a combination of the basic data distribution methods; a table is partitioned by one data distribution method and then each partition is further subdivided into subpartitions using a second data distribution method. All subpartitions for a given partition together represent a logical subset of the data.
 Composite partitioning supports historical operations, such as adding new range partitions, but also provides higher degrees of potential partition pruning and finer granularity of data placement through subpartitioning. Figure 2-3 offers a graphical view of range-hash and range-list composite partitioning, as an example.
 Composite range-hash partitioning partitions data using the range method, and within each partition, subpartitions it using the hash method. Composite range-hash partitioning provides the improved manageability of range partitioning and the data placement, striping, and parallelism advantages of hash partitioning.
 Composite range-list partitioning partitions data using the range method, and within each partition, subpartitions it using the list method. Composite range-list partitioning provides the manageability of range partitioning and the explicit control of list partitioning for the subpartitions.
 In addition to the basic partitioning strategies, Oracle Database provides partitioning extensions:
 These extensions significantly enhance the manageability of partitioned tables:
 Interval partitioning is an extension of range partitioning which instructs the database to automatically create partitions of a specified interval when data inserted into the table exceeds all of the existing range partitions. You must specify at least one range partition. The range partitioning key value determines the high value of the range partitions, which is called the transition point, and the database creates interval partitions for data beyond that transition point. The lower boundary of every interval partition is the non-inclusive upper boundary of the previous range or interval partition.
 For example, if you create an interval partitioned table with monthly intervals and the transition point at January 1, 2007, then the lower boundary for the January 2007 interval is January 1, 2007. The lower boundary for the July 2007 interval is July 1, 2007, regardless of whether the June 2007 partition was already created.
 When using interval partitioning, consider the following restrictions:
 You can only specify one partitioning key column, and it must be of
 Interval partitioning is not supported for index-organized tables.
 You cannot create a domain index on an interval-partitioned table.
 You can create single-level interval partitioned tables as well as the following composite partitioned tables:
 The Partition Advisor is part of the SQL Access Advisor. The Partition Advisor can recommend a partitioning strategy for a table based on a supplied workload of SQL statements which can be supplied by the SQL Cache, a SQL Tuning set, or be defined by the user.
 These extensions extend the flexibility in defining partitioning keys:
 Reference partitioning allows the partitioning of two tables related to one another by referential constraints. The partitioning key is resolved through an existing parent-child relationship, enforced by enabled and active primary key and foreign key constraints.
 The benefit of this extension is that tables with a parent-child relationship can be logically equi-partitioned by inheriting the partitioning key from the parent table without duplicating the key columns. The logical dependency will also automatically cascade partition maintenance operations, thus making application development easier and less error-prone.
 An example of reference partitioning is the
 OrderItems tables related to each other by a referential constraint
 Orders table is range partitioned on
 OrderDate. Reference partitioning on
 OrderItems leads to creation of the following partitioned table, which is equi-partitioned with respect to the
 Orders table, as shown in Figure 2-4 and Figure 2-5.
 All basic partitioning strategies are available for reference Partitioning. Interval partitioning cannot be used with reference partitioning.
 In previous releases of the Oracle Database, a table could only be partitioned if the partitioning key physically existed in the table. In Oracle Database 11g, virtual columns remove that restriction and allow the partitioning key to be defined by an expression, using one or more existing columns of a table. The expression is stored as metadata only.
 Oracle Partitioning has been enhanced to allow a partitioning strategy to be defined on virtual columns. For example, a 10 digit account ID can include account branch information as the leading 3 digits. With the extension of virtual column based Partitioning, an
 ACCOUNTS table containing an
 ACCOUNT_ID column can be extended with a virtual (derived) column
 ACCOUNT_BRANCH that is derived from the first three digits of the
 ACCOUNT_ID column, which becomes the partitioning key for this table.
 Virtual column-based Partitioning is supported with all basic partitioning strategies, including interval and interval-* composite partitioning.
 Just like partitioned tables, partitioned indexes improve manageability, availability, performance, and scalability. They can either be partitioned independently (global indexes) or automatically linked to a table's partitioning method (local indexes). In general, you should use global indexes for OLTP applications and local indexes for data warehousing or DSS applications. Also, whenever possible, you should try to use local indexes because they are easier to manage. When deciding what kind of partitioned index to use, you should consider the following guidelines in order:
 If the table partitioning column is a subset of the index keys, use a local index. If this is the case, you are finished. If this is not the case, continue to guideline 2.
 If the index is unique and does not include the partitioning key columns, then use a global index. If this is the case, then you are finished. Otherwise, continue to guideline 3.
 If your priority is manageability, use a local index. If this is the case, you are finished. If this is not the case, continue to guideline 4.
 If the application is an OLTP one and users need quick response times, use a global index. If the application is a DSS one and users are more interested in throughput, use a local index.
 See Also:Chapter 6, ""Using Partitioning in a Data Warehouse Environment"" and Chapter 7, ""Using Partitioning in an Online Transaction Processing Environment"" for more information about partitioned indexes and how to decide which type to use
 Local partitioned indexes are easier to manage than other types of partitioned indexes. They also offer greater availability and are common in DSS environments. The reason for this is equipartitioning: each partition of a local index is associated with exactly one partition of the table. This enables Oracle to automatically keep the index partitions in sync with the table partitions, and makes each table-index pair independent. Any actions that make one partition's data invalid or unavailable only affect a single partition.
 Local partitioned indexes support more availability when there are partition or subpartition maintenance operations on the table. A type of index called a local nonprefixed index is very useful for historical databases. In this type of index, the partitioning is not on the left prefix of the index columns.
 See Also:Chapter 4 for more information about prefixed indexes
 You cannot explicitly add a partition to a local index. Instead, new partitions are added to local indexes only when you add a partition to the underlying table. Likewise, you cannot explicitly drop a partition from a local index. Instead, local index partitions are dropped only when you drop a partition from the underlying table.
 A local index can be unique. However, in order for a local index to be unique, the partitioning key of the table must be part of the index's key columns.
 Figure 2-6 offers a graphical view of local partitioned indexes.
 Oracle offers two types of global partitioned indexes: range partitioned and hash partitioned.
 Global range partitioned indexes are flexible in that the degree of partitioning and the partitioning key are independent from the table's partitioning method.
 The highest partition of a global index must have a partition bound, all of whose values are
 MAXVALUE. This ensures that all rows in the underlying table can be represented in the index. Global prefixed indexes can be unique or nonunique.
 You cannot add a partition to a global index because the highest partition always has a partition bound of
 MAXVALUE. If you wish to add a new highest partition, use the
 PARTITION statement. If a global index partition is empty, you can explicitly drop it by issuing the
 PARTITION statement. If a global index partition contains data, dropping the partition causes the next highest partition to be marked unusable. You cannot drop the highest partition in a global index.
 Global hash partitioned indexes improve performance by spreading out contention when the index is monotonically growing. In other words, most of the index insertions occur only on the right edge of an index.
 By default, the following operations on partitions on a heap-organized table mark all global indexes as unusable:
 ADD (HASH) COALESCE (HASH) DROP EXCHANGE MERGE MOVE SPLIT TRUNCATE
 These indexes can be maintained by appending the clause
 UPDATE INDEXES to the SQL statements for the operation. The two advantages to maintaining global indexes:
 The index remains available and online throughout the operation. Hence no other applications are affected by this operation.
 The index doesn't have to be rebuilt after the operation.
 Note:This feature is supported only for heap-organized tables.
 Figure 2-7 offers a graphical view of global partitioned indexes.
 Global non-partitioned indexes behave just like a non-partitioned index.
 Figure 2-8 offers a graphical view of global non-partitioned indexes.
 You can create bitmap indexes on partitioned tables, with the restriction that the bitmap indexes must be local to the partitioned table. They cannot be global indexes.
 Global indexes can be unique. Local indexes can only be unique if the partitioning key is a part of the index key. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

The grade level is a natural partitioning key, and by partitioning the data based on this key, we can reduce the number of rows to be scanned during queries and improve overall performance.
 
 **Partitioning Plan:**
 
 * **Table Structure:** The student records table will have the following columns: student ID, name, grade level, and GPA.
 * **Partitioning Key:** The grade level column will be used as the partitioning key.
 * **Partition Boundaries:** The partition boundaries will be set as follows:
  * Freshman (grade level 9-10)
  * Sophomore (grade level 11-12)
  * Junior (grade level 13-14)
  * Senior (grade level 15-16)
 * **Partition Management:** Each partition will be stored in a separate tablespace to improve manageability and availability. The database administrator can easily manage and maintain individual partitions as needed.
 * **Maintenance and Performance:** Range partitioning will improve query performance by reducing the number of rows to be scanned during queries. Additionally, the database can use partition pruning to further improve performance. The database administrator can maintain the partitions by performing routine maintenance tasks, such as reorganizing indexes and updating statistics.
 
 **Advantages:**
 
 * Improved query performance due to reduced number of rows to be scanned
 * Efficient storage and retrieval of student records based on grade level
 * Easy management and maintenance of individual partitions
 
 **Disadvantages:**
 
 * May require additional storage space for partitioned tables
 * May require additional maintenance tasks to maintain partitioning scheme
 
 **Conclusion:** Range partitioning is an effective strategy for the school database as it allows for efficient storage and retrieval of student records based on grade level. By partitioning the data based on this key, we can improve query performance and reduce the number of rows to be scanned during queries.
 
 **Note:** The Partition Advisor can be used to recommend a partitioning strategy for the school database based on a supplied workload of SQL statements. The Partition Advisor can also be used to analyze the performance of the partitioning scheme and provide recommendations for improvement.","### FEEDBACK:

 Snowmass fossil site continues to be ‚Äòtreasure trove‚Äô
 Day by day, an Ice Age fossil site discovered last fall near Snowmass Village is continuing to grow in stature and scientific importance as excavators retrieve bones by the boxes full.
 The Denver Museum of Nature & Science resumed digging at the site this spring, and by Thursday night had racked up 864 fossils, even more than the 600 or so found last fall.
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre pulling out about a hundred bones a day now,‚Äù said paleontologist Kirk Johnson, who is leading the excavation for the museum.
 He said the success of the excavation and its discoveries are exceeding expectations.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a treasure trove. It‚Äôs amazing,‚Äù he said.
 The first discovery of fossils occurred Oct. 14, when a contractor unearthed bones from a Columbian mammoth during expansion of a reservoir for the town of Snowmass Village. Within a month, excavators unearthed bones from another mammoth, and from mastodons, an Ice Age bison, a Jefferson‚Äôs ground sloth, an Ice Age deer and other animals.
 Previously, only three mastodons had been discovered in Colorado. The Jefferson‚Äôs ground sloth discovery was a first for Colorado, and Snowmass was the only place in Colorado, and one of few places in North America, where mammoths and mastodons have been found in the same location.
 This spring‚Äôs discoveries include an Ice Age camel and parts of other animals that have yet to be identified. But, Johnson said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really turning into a mastodon story this year. Boy, we‚Äôre going to have a smashing collection of mastodons in Denver.‚Äù
 The museum had trademarked a name ‚Äî the Snowmastodon Project ‚Äî that has become particularly fitting in light of this spring‚Äôs findings. Johnson said crews this year have discovered the bottom of an ancient lake bed covered with skulls, tusks, limb bones and other mastodon fossils, from infant to adult. They‚Äôve found a 7-inch thigh bone believed to have come from a fetal mastodon, which compares with the 4-foot thighs of adults.
 With as many as 27 tusks discovered to date, that means a minimum of 14 mastodon discoveries, which compares with a record of 31 at any one site. But researchers won‚Äôt know how many individual animals they‚Äôve discovered until they‚Äôve had a closer look at the fossils, Johnson said.
 Also being discovered at the same level are fossils of trees and an abundance of pollen that suggest the mastodons lived in a warmer, interglacial period of probably more than 100,000 years ago.
 ‚ÄúIt looks ‚Ä¶ like the animals just lived and died along the shores of this lake, and the lake was very efficient in accumulating and preserving the bones,‚Äù Johnson said.
 That contrasts with a higher layer of peat where mammoths, bison and deer were found, in some cases apparently because they became stuck in the peat and couldn‚Äôt escape.
 When they first resumed digging at the site, excavation crews this spring could relate to those animals‚Äô fates. For the first 11 days, heavy snow and other precipitation resulted in about one-third of those working on-site each day finding themselves stuck in mud, Johnson said.
 ‚ÄúIt was a total quagmire,‚Äù he said.
 This is the museum‚Äôs largest fossil-excavation project. By Friday, the resumption of digging was in its 21st day.
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve pulled together a great team of 36 scientists from 17 universities in four countries, and they‚Äôre really deeply engaged,‚Äù Johnson said.
 Also on-site are 107 trained volunteers, 35 staff members and nine interns. Another dozen or so people will join the crew this weekend, and a group of local educators also has been selected to help out this month and share their experiences with students and their communities.
 Johnson said a few ‚Äúexpert dinosaur diggers‚Äù have been recruited to help protect the numerous big bones being discovered by encasing them in plaster.
 The crews have until July 1 to finish work on what is considered the best Ice Age fossil site in Colorado and best high-elevation Ice Age site in North America. After that, the Snowmass Water & Sanitation District needs to resume enlargement of the reservoir in order to help meet the town‚Äôs water needs.
 Johnson said an observer or two will remain on-site during construction work this summer to keep an eye out for any other fossils that might surface.
 The reservoir will be lined with impermeable clay, and any fossils not yet uncovered will remain protected and in place, awaiting possible excavation in some future generation after the reservoir is decommissioned.
 Because of the hurry to keep digging this spring, no public access is being provided to the dig site. A staffed, interpretative display can be found at the Snowmass Mall in Snowmass Village all summer, and on June 18‚Äì19, the Snowmass Ice Age Spectacular is planned, featuring unearthed bones and live broadcasts from the dig site.
 Johnson said there will be a public talk June 15 at Colorado Mountain College in Glenwood Springs and two public events June 23 at the Aspen Institute.
 The water district, town and museum have set a $1 million fundraising goal to help cover excavation, preservation, public outreach and other aspects of the project. With a recent $100,000 donation by the Crown family, which owns the Aspen Skiing Co., $460,000 has been raised to date.
 As excited as Johnson is about the discoveries at the site to date, he said one thing noticeably lacking is any carnivore fossils. Scientists still hope to find signs of predators such as wolves, bears or saber-toothed tigers.
 ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some cool animals that ought to be here that we haven‚Äôt seen yet,‚Äù he said. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Compare and contrast the discovery of fossils in the higher layer of peat and the lower layer of ancient lake bed at the Snowmass Ice Age fossil site.
 
 In a paragraph, describe the type of animals found at each layer and explain how they likely ended up there.
 Include in your comparison the environmental conditions inferred from the fossils and other evidence at each layer.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 The discovery of fossils in the higher layer of peat and the lower layer of ancient lake bed at the Snowmass Ice Age fossil site reveals distinct differences in the types of animals found and the environmental conditions that existed at each layer. In the higher layer of peat, fossils of mammoths, bison, and deer were found, often with evidence suggesting that they became stuck in the peat and were unable to escape. In contrast, the lower layer of ancient lake bed yielded a large collection of mastodon fossils, including skulls, tusks, limb bones, and other remains, from infant to adult. The presence of tree fossils and an abundance of pollen at this layer suggests that the mastodons lived in a warmer, interglacial period, likely over 100,000 years ago. The environmental conditions at the two layers differ, with the peat layer indicating a colder, wetter climate, and the lake bed layer suggesting a more temperate climate with a lake that efficiently accumulated and preserved the bones. The differences in fossil discoveries and environmental conditions at each layer provide valuable insights into the lives and habitats of these Ice Age animals.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Your comparison of the discovery of fossils in the higher layer of peat and the lower layer of ancient lake bed at the Snowmass Ice Age fossil site is thorough and well-supported by the text.
 
 To strengthen your comparison, consider explicitly stating the environmental conditions inferred from the fossils and other evidence at each layer, as mentioned in the text. For example, you could mention that the peat layer suggests a colder, wetter climate, while the lake bed layer suggests a more temperate climate with a lake that efficiently accumulated and preserved the bones.
 Additionally, consider providing more specific details about the types of animals found at each layer. For example, you could mention that the peat layer yielded fossils of mammoths, bison, and deer, as well as evidence of their entrapment in the peat. In contrast, the lake bed layer yielded a large collection of mastodon fossils, including skulls, tusks, limb bones, and other remains, from infant to adult.","### FEEDBACK: ASSIGNMENT
 
 Your comparison and contrast of the higher layer of peat and the lower layer of ancient lake bed at the Snowmass Ice Age fossil site is well-structured and effectively conveys the differences in the types of animals found and the environmental conditions at each layer.
 
 However, there are a few areas where improvement is needed:
 
 * In the higher layer of peat, you mention that mammoths, bison, and deer were found, but you do not provide specific details about how they likely ended up there. Consider adding more information to support your explanation.
 * In the lower layer of ancient lake bed, you describe the presence of tree fossils and pollen, but you do not explain how these findings relate to the warmer, interglacial period. Make sure to connect the dots between the evidence and your explanation.
 * Consider using more precise vocabulary and sentence structures to enhance clarity and concision.
 
 ### EXAMPLE OF REVISED PARAGRAPH:
 
 The discovery of fossils in the higher layer of peat and the lower layer of ancient lake bed at the Snowmass Ice Age fossil site reveals distinct differences in the types of animals found and the environmental conditions that existed at each layer. In the higher layer of peat, fossils of mammoths, bison, and deer were found, often with evidence suggesting that they became stuck in the peat and were unable to escape. This suggests that the climate in this region was colder and wetter, making it difficult for these animals to move or escape. In contrast, the lower layer of ancient lake bed yielded a large collection of mastodon fossils, including skulls, tusks, limb bones, and other remains, from infant to adult. The presence of tree fossils and an abundance of pollen at this layer suggests that the mastodons lived in a warmer, interglacial period, likely over 100,000 years ago, when the lake was a temperate environment that efficiently accumulated and preserved the bones. The differences in fossil discoveries and environmental conditions at each layer provide valuable insights into the lives and habitats of these Ice Age animals.",A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Ballets Russes, Erik Satie, Igor Stravinsky, Manuel de Falla, Olga Kokhlova, Parade, Paulo Picasso, Pulchinella, Sergei Diaghilev, The Three-Cornered Hat
 (All images may be enlarged by clicking on them.)
 Picasso[i] had several relationships, but he was a husband to Russian ballerina Olga Kokhlova (17 June 1891 ‚Äì 11 February 1955). He met Olga during the production of the Ballets Russes‚Äò Parade (1917). In the early years of the twentieth century, there was no better creative milieu in Paris than Sergei Diaghilev‚Äòs (1872 ‚Äì1929) Ballets Russes. The Russian impresario recruited the most talented individuals of his days and, among them, Pablo Picasso (25 October 1881 ‚Äì 8 April 1973). When he was employed by Sergei Diaghilev, Picasso was mixing with le tout Paris, or the cream of Parisian society.
 The Legend Begins
 Sergei Diaghilev‚Äôs Ballets Russes√ârik Satie (composer) Jean Cocteau (writer) Ernest Ansermet (conductor) Manuel de Falla (composer) L√©onide Massine (choreographer) Igor Stravinsky (composer) L√©on Bakst (costume and set designer) Alexandre Benois (costume and set designer) Marius Petipa (choreographer) Michel Fokine (choreographer) Vaslav Nijinsky (ballet dancer and choreographer) Pablo Picasso (set and costume designer)
 For instance, the production of the ballet Parade (1917) brought together composer √ârik Satie (17 May 1866 ‚Äì 1 July 1925), legendary writer and future filmmaker Jean Cocteau (5 July 1889 ‚Äì11 October 1963) and choreographer L√©onide Massine (9 August 1896 ‚Äì 15 March 1979).
 √ârik Satie (17 May 1866 ‚Äì 1 July 1925) was one of the main composers of his era. Beginning in 1888, Satie composed the Gymnop√©dies.[ii] Jean Cocteau is the author of the 1929 novel Les Enfants terribles, which he would transform into a film in 1950.[iii] Finally, when it premi√®red at Paris‚Äô Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet, on 18 May 1917, Parade was conducted by Ernest Ansermet (11 November 1883 ‚Äì 20 February 1969) who founded l‚ÄôOrchestre de la Suisse Romande (1918).
 Shown below is Parade‚Äòs curtain, Picasso‚Äôs largest work. It features the nimble Harlequin, a recurring figure in Picasso‚Äôs artwork, portrayed here in the artist‚Äôs first work as costume and set designer. Parade‚Äôs curtain also features mythology‚Äôs winged horse Pegasus. Later in Picasso‚Äôs career, mythology, the Minotaur in particular, would be a significant motif.
 (Please click on the images to enlarge them.)
 The Legend Continues‚Ä¶
 The Three-Cornered Hat (1919)
 In 1919, Ernest Ansermet would conduct Manuel de Falla‚Äòs (23 November 1876 ‚Äì 14 November 1946) El Sombrero de tres picos (The Three-Cornered Hat or Le Tricorne), a Ballets Russes production choreographed by L√©onide Massine with costumes and set designed by Pablo Picasso. The Three-Cornered Hat premi√®red in London at the Alhambra Theatre, on 22 July 1919.
 Pulcinella (Polichinelle) is a zanni from la commedia dell‚Äôarte. Igor Stravinsky composed the music. The ballet was choreographed by L√©onide Massine, who also wrote the ballet‚Äôs libretto (the text), and Pablo Picasso designed the costumes and the set. Pulchinella was first performed on 15 May 1920 under the baton of Ernest Ansermet at the Paris Opera (Palais Garnier).
 The Ballets Russes would also employ costume and set designers L√©on Bakst and Alexandre Benois (both Russian) and choreographers Marius Petipa and Michel Fokine. However, the Ballets Russes had no greater star than Polish ballet dancer and choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky (12 March 1889/1890 [Kiev]‚Äì 8 April 1950).
 Diaghilev was at times a little too punctilious, but his contribution to what composer Richard Wagner called Gesamtkunstwerk (total art) is exemplary. The Ballets Russes defined an entire era of the twentieth century and Pablo Picasso‚Äôs work with the company gave enormous impetus to his career.
 Allow me to quote the UK Guardian (Luke Jennings; 10 May 2010), on the Ballets Russes:
 This was more than just a dance company; it was a creative movement which, from its inception, drew to itself the greatest musical, theatrical and artistic talents of the day.
 American writer Gertrude Stein lived here with her brother Leo and then with Alice B. Toklas. She received numerous artists and writers from 1903 to 1938.
 Americans in Paris: Gertrude Stein
 On 4 April 2013, I posted an article entitled Henri Matisse: an Eclectic Modernist. It refers to Picasso‚Äôs acquaintance with Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas, members of Stein‚Äôs family, and the Cone sisters. The next two paragraphs are therefore somewhat repetitive. Yet, it should be mentioned that Picasso‚Äôs most fervent aficionados and promoters were Americans in Paris. He owes much of his relatively early success to Leo Stein and his sister Gertrude Stein (3 February 1874 ‚Äì 27 July 1946). In fact, we could start a whole new series entitled: Americans in Paris. These Americans were wealthy and became patrons to the Impressionists and all that was avant-gardiste in Paris: Fauvism, Cubism, Surrealism, etc.
 Gertrude Stein was a salonni√®re. Few addresses are as famous as 27, rue de Fleurus, Paris 6. An invitation to 27, rue de Fleurus, Stein‚Äôs home and that of her lover, Alice B. Toklas, was almost as much a privilege in twentieth-century Paris as entr√©e to Madame Geoffrin‚Äòs Parisian salon had been in the eighteenth century.
 Madame Stein is the Gertrude Stein of ‚Äúa rose is a rose is a rose‚Äù who entitled her 1933 autobiography The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas. As for Alice B. Toklas, Stein‚Äôs lover, she is the author of the Alice B. Toklas Cookbook of the famous hashish cookies. Born in 1877, Alice died in poverty, the victim of greed, on 7 March 1967, aged 89. (See Henri Matisse: an Eclectic Modernist.)
 Olga Kokhlova was a socialite and therefore facilitated Picasso‚Äôs introduction to Paris‚Äô world of music, design, choreography, dance, and literature. The two married on 18 May 1917 and, three years after Parade, on 4 February 1921, Olga gave birth to Picasso‚Äôs first son, Paulo, depicted above as Harlequin and Pierrot (Pedrolino), Commedia dell‚Äôarte figures.
 Picasso‚Äôs marriage to Olga (17 June 1891 ‚Äì on 11 February 1955) was not a happy union. It seems the two were not suited for one another. In 1927, Picasso entered into a relationship with another woman. Olga left in 1935 and, as is well known, Picasso refused to divorce her because he would have had to give her half of his belongings, including his paintings. That was not acceptable to him. (See Olga Khokhlova, Wikipedia.)
 But let us return to Harlequin. In 1906, Picasso depicted him as dead (see below). At that point, reports of Harlequin‚Äôs death were premature. Picasso continued to depict Harlequin and other characters from the Commedia dell‚Äôarte, which makes him heir to Jean-Antoine Watteau (baptised 10 October 1684 ‚Äì 18 July 1721).
 However, Picasso‚Äôs settings of Commedia dell‚Äôarte figures are less ethereal than Watteau‚Äôs bucolic f√™tes galantes. Yet both artists drew part of their subject matter from Italian comedy and from ballet, without portraying disorderly buffoons. Picasso was also influenced by seventeenth-century Spanish artists Diego Vel√°squez ‚Äì ‚ÄúLas Meninas‚Äù ‚Äì and El Greco.
 In short, despite a failed marriage, Paris was kind to Picasso who remembered Harlequin and other characters from the Commedia dell‚Äôarte.
 I apologize for not posting more often. The problem is a long and disabling episode of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
 Kind regards to all of you. ‚ô•

 5 Ways AI is Already Part of Your Daily Life
 When we think about AI, we tend to envision a futuristic technology which is yet to become integrated with society. The reality is actually very different. Most of us interact with AI on a daily basis, but are simply unaware of its presence.
 Here are 5 ways AI is already a more significant part of your life than you think.
 1 ‚Äì Media Streaming Services
 Almost everyone uses a streaming platform of some description. Netflix, Spotify and YouTube are all good examples. However, not so many of us are aware that your next suggested song or video is being recommended by AI. Algorithms analyse what you watch or listen to, and once enough data has been collected, will start suggesting content which matches your interests. A very similar process occurs with online shopping and recommended products.
 2 ‚Äì Voice Assistants
 It could be Siri, Cortana, or Alexa. Voice assistants have become a common accessory, with almost every smartphone having one. But did you know these smart assistants use a form of AI known as Natural Language Processing (or NLP) to understand what you are saying? They learn from your requests and commands, creating an increasingly tailored user experience based on the information you provide.
 3 ‚Äì Spam Filters
 Junk mail is one of those annoying facts of life, fortunately filters usually do a great job of identifying what is and isn‚Äôt spam. The filters utilise Machine Learning, where the machine (algorithm) is trained to differentiate between genuine emails and spam. This process works by highlighting keywords which are typically associated with spam, and using them to assess incoming mail. Sometimes junk mail may slip through the net, but by flagging it as spam, you are essentially teaching the algorithm to filter similar emails in the future!
 4 ‚Äì Fraud Detection
 Almost 1/10 adults in the UK (9%) have been a victim of card fraud, and this figure is expected to rise. As a result, banks have implemented sophisticated fraud detection systems which can identify suspicious activity on your card. But how do these systems work? AI is used to gather behavioral information, such as your spending habits and location of transactions. It can then use this information to identify suspicious activity, like unusually large or frequent transactions in a short space of time, and notify your bank.
 5 ‚Äì Customer Support
 Customer support has become increasingly AI-based over the past decade. This has mainly been achieved through the use of chatbots. Just like voice assistants, these bots use NLP to process customer queries and formulate a helpful response with the information they have access to, i.e. opening times, return policies or contact information. If a question is asked that the bot cannot answer, or does not understand, it can notify a member of the customer service team to step in and continue the conversation.
 Hopefully this has demonstrated how AI is already a significant part of our daily lives. There are many other examples outside of this list, and as time passes we will see this technology take on even more responsibility in both the workplace and at home.

 Design a New AI-Powered Application for Daily Life
 
 Imagine you have the opportunity to create a new AI-powered application that could be used by people in their daily lives. Choose a problem or task that you think AI could help solve, and describe how your application would use AI to address this problem. Be sure to include what type of AI technology your application would use (e.g. Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, etc.) and how it would improve people's daily lives.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 I propose an AI-powered application called 'DreamPal' that helps people improve their sleep quality by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. DreamPal would be a voice assistant that utilizes NLP to monitor and analyze users' sleep patterns, including sleep duration, quality, and stages (e.g., REM, non-REM). The application would also use Machine Learning to identify factors that affect users' sleep, such as caffeine consumption, physical activity, and screen time. Based on this data, DreamPal would provide users with personalized recommendations to enhance their sleep quality, such as suggesting relaxing exercises, setting a consistent sleep schedule, or limiting caffeine intake before bedtime.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Assignment Submission
 
 Your assignment, ""Design a New AI-Powered Application for Daily Life,"" showcases your creativity and understanding of AI technologies. Here are some specific points to consider for improvement:
 
 1. **Clear Problem Statement**: Your proposal, ""DreamPal,"" addresses a significant issue (improving sleep quality) and demonstrates how AI can help solve it. However, consider adding more context or background information about the problem and its impact on daily life.
 2. **AI Technology Selection**: You've chosen NLP and Machine Learning for DreamPal. To further strengthen your proposal, research other AI technologies that could complement or enhance your application, such as Computer Vision or Predictive Analytics.
 3. **User Experience and Interface**: While you've described the functionality of DreamPal, consider adding more details about the user interface and experience. How will users interact with the application? What features will be most intuitive and user-friendly?
 4. **Data Collection and Security**: As DreamPal collects sensitive sleep data, ensure that you've considered the importance of data security and privacy. Outline measures to protect user data and maintain confidentiality.
 5. **Potential Challenges and Limitations**: Anticipate potential challenges or limitations of DreamPal, such as user compliance with recommendations or technical issues with the application. Develop strategies to address these concerns and ensure the long-term success of your application.
 
 ### FEEDBACK FOR NEXT ASSIGNMENT
 
 To take your assignment to the next level, focus on:
 
 * Conducting thorough research on AI technologies and their applications in daily life
 * Developing a clear and concise problem statement
 * Creating a user-friendly interface and experience
 * Ensuring data security and privacy measures are in place
 * Anticipating and addressing potential challenges and limitations
 
 By addressing these areas, you'll be well on your way to creating a compelling and effective AI-powered application that improves daily life.","### FEEDBACK: Your proposal for DreamPal is a great start, but there are a few areas that need improvement.
 
 To make your proposal more comprehensive, consider adding a section on how DreamPal would address potential biases in its sleep quality analysis. For example, you could discuss how the application would account for differences in sleep patterns between men and women, or how it would handle cases where users have underlying medical conditions that affect their sleep.
 To make your proposal more actionable, consider adding a section on how you would test and validate DreamPal's effectiveness. For example, you could discuss how you would conduct user studies to evaluate the application's impact on sleep quality, or how you would use data from existing sleep tracking devices to validate the accuracy of DreamPal's analysis.",B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 ‚ÄúTHE MALAYSIA MISSION OF THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH‚Äù
 By : The Rev. JOHN RUSSELL DENYES
 MISSIONARY, SINGAPORE MALAYSIA, 1869
 Saya memetik tulisan yang di buat pengarang bagi makluman semua tentang bagaimana kristian berdakawah di Malaysia. Buku ini telah di tulis 140 tahun dahulu dan sangat menarik untuk tatapan kita semua.
 Malaysia merangkumi Indonesia, Semenanjung, Borneo dan Filipina
 Dalam tulisannya Rev John Russell menyifatkan seluruh kepualaun Melayu ini sebagai Malaysia. Ini membawa erti bahawa semua kepualaun ini adalah merupakan satu negara sebelum dipecah-pecahkan oleh barat.
 ‚ÄúMalaysia, the home of the Malay, or brown man, to the southeast of Asia, between Indo-China and Austraha. It includes the Malay Peninsula and the larger half of the islands of the Eastern Archipelago. The Land group are Sumatra, a country as large as the States of Areas Iowa, Missouri, and Arkansas; Java, of the size of New York State; Celebes, the territorial equal of all New England; Borneo, nearly four times as large as Illinois; and all the hundreds of lesser islands and islets which appear so insignificant upon the map, but which are in reality countries capable of supporting a large population. The Philippine Islands are properly a part of Malaysia, but as they are treated in a separate booklet they will not be discussed further in this one.
 The land area embraced within the bounds of Malaysia amounts to seven hundred thousand square miles, a territory equal to one fifth of the area of the United States. Much of the country is mountainous. In Sumatra and Java and in many of the smaller islands there are active volcanoes, and these countries are subject to frequent and violent earthquakes. The climate is hot and moist. The Climate thermometer stands at about ninety degrees in the shade the year around.‚Äù
 Agama orang Melayu ketika itu
 ‚ÄúSpeaking generally, the Malays are Mohammedans. Before the introduction of Mohammedanism, Brahmanism, Sivaism, and Buddliism prevailed largely throughout Sumatra and Java. This is shown by the numerous ruins of old temples, scattered all over these Mohammedans islands. Even now Islam does not mean here what it does in Arabia and Turkey. The Malay has adopted the creed of Mohammed, but this has ‚Äúonly increased the number of supersensual beings to whom he prays.‚Äù
 Bila Dakwah Kristian Bermula ?
 ‚ÄúMission work has been carried on among the people of the Dutch possessions in Malaysia since 1603. The results have not been very gratifying, owing partly to the methods adopted and partly to the opposition of the government to the use of aggressive measures in evangelization. Dr. Callenbach, a Dutch authority, says that in 1900 there were ‚Äù some 41 European clergymen and evangelists, aided by 355 ordained natives, native preachers and teachers, working among 234,073 natives of the undenominational Protestant Church of the East Indies.‚Äù
 Penumpuan Kristian Kepada Pelajar2 Sekolah
 ‚ÄúThe people are content with their own way of living, and resent any interference on the part of a foreigner. But let a boy or a girl become a pupil in one of the mission schools,and the whole situation is at once altered. Interest in a child gives free access to the home and frequently to the hearts of the parents.
 The objects of these schools are to educate the children of native Christians, to open the homes of the people to the missionaries, to remove the prejudices of the people against Christianity, and to open the eyes of the younger.
 Their aims generation to the moral and spiritual possibilities to be found nowhere but in the Gospel. To this end chapel services are held daily. The children are taught to sing Christian songs, and are instructed in the fundamental truths of religion. Vohintarv Bible classes are conducted, at which a good percentage of the students are in attendance. Lessons are explained from the Christian viewpoint,and five days every week the pupils are under the influence of earnest Christian teachers.‚Äù
 Hasil Dakwah kepada pelajar
 ‚ÄúAt the close of 1903 there were in Malaysia, apart from the Philippines, 26 schools, with 112 teachers and an enrollment of 3,270 pupils. The Sunday schools numbered 4G, with 102 teachers and 1,757 scholars.There were 12 foreign missionaries, 8 assistant missionaries,8 representatives of the Woman‚Äôs Foreign Missionary Society,57 local preachers, and 1,467 church members and probationers.
 The Epworth League has begun its work among the youth, showing its worth here as in other mission fields. But these figures do not tell the whole story of missionary effort. Thousands of Bibles, tracts. Scripture-text pictures, and religious periodicals have been placed in non-Christian homes. Several thousand young men and young women have come under the influence of our mission schools,and while they are not as yet Christians, they have lost faith in idolatry.
 A Christian sentiment has begun to pervade public thought, and on every hand are indications that the field is white already to the harvest.‚Äù
 Cara Mubaligh berdakwah di kampung2
 ‚ÄúThe opening of a new station in a village or a neighborhood is Reaching usually preceded by street preaching. A missionary,the Natives with a native helper or two, finds his way into av illage, selects a convenient street corner, and begins to sing. The unusual noise attracts a crowd. The missionary mounts a doorstep or box, and explains the nature of his message and calls upon his helpers to testify to the poAver of the Gospel. Portions of the Bible,tracts, and Christian calendars are offered for sale.
 Sometimes these visits are made at night, and magic lantern pictures are thrown upon a screen while the missionary tells the stories of the Bible. Sooner or later some man will be found who is ready to offer the use of a room in his home for a small rental or free for the services. As soon as the prejudice has disappeared sufficiently for the people to sit quietly and listen the crowd is divided into smaller groups, w^here more direct and personal work can be done. This is the beginning of the Sunday school. As converts begin to come in, a rudimentary church organization‚Äù
 Penumpuan kepada China dan India
 Kekuatan orang2 Melayu memegang islam menyebabkan mereka menumpu kepada Cina dan India.
 ‚ÄúUp to the present time the difficulty of reaching the bigoted and fanatical Mohammedan Malays has led to the concentration of efforts upon the Chinese and the Tamils, as they represent the way of least resistance. There is good reason to believe, however, that aggressive work among the more primitive peoples of the jungles would soon yield a large harvest.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúThe first difficulty to be met in solving the problem is that of language. Malaysia is the meeting place of all languages and dialects. More than fifty languages, to say nothing of the minor dialects, are spoken on the streets of Singapore. The presiding elder of the Singapore District Speech holds Quarterly Conferences in seven distinct languages. When the various native workers are gathered together in Di.strict or Annual Conference the question of secretaries and interpreters becomes a serious one.
 The language of commerce is Malay, but although the people of every land soon pick up enough of this language to transact ordinary business, very few of them ever learn enough of it to receive rehgious instruction in it. There is no other way but to seek each group in its ownl tongue. This means that every missionary who survives long enough must learn from one to five languages.‚Äù
 Pergerakan Kristian di Pulau Pinang
 ‚ÄúThe records of the same 5‚Ä≤ear begin the stor}‚Äô of another mission that has proved more successful. At the Annual Meeting it was decided to open work in Penang, on the westcoast of the peninsula. Penang is the second city in the Straits Settlements, and has a population of about one hundred and twenty-five thousand people, most of them being Chinese or Tamils.
 ‚ÄúThe island of Penang was acquired by the English government by cession from a native prince in 1785 for the small annual payment of $6,000. It is two miles from the mainland, and is twelve miles long and nine wide. Later a small strip was taken possession of on the opposite coast to arrest the Malay piracy of that part of the high seas. This strip is known as Province Wellesley, and was purchased for an annuity of $2,000.‚Äù \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

 Explore Through Movement and Play
 Encourage curiosity, discovery, and a healthy body.
 Sink or Float
 On and Off
 Move Arms and Legs
 Help with Experiments
 Let Them Move Around
 Why This Matters
 Infants and toddlers are like scientists‚Äîcurious and excited to learn about their surroundings. Children explore and learn about the world through movement and play. There are many kinds of play: exploring objects and their features using the senses, silly games with loved ones, imaginative and pretend play, creative activities such as drawing, and physical play, such as crawling or rolling a ball. Movement and play keep children healthy and build their coordination and strength.
 Your child benefits from spending some playing with others, and some time playing alone, figuring things out independently (with you nearby). Help them build on their interests and see where their curiosity takes them. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Analyze the concept of movement and play in infants and toddlers, and discuss its impact on their cognitive, social, and physical development.
 
 Explain how movement and play contribute to the cognitive development of infants and toddlers, using examples from the text to support your argument.
 Discuss the role of caregiver involvement in promoting healthy movement and play habits in young children, and provide suggestions for caregivers to encourage independent play while still maintaining a supportive presence.
 Compare and contrast the different types of play mentioned in the text, and argue for the importance of providing opportunities for children to engage in a variety of play experiences.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 Movement and play are crucial components of infants and toddlers cognitive, social, and physical development.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Your analysis of the concept of movement and play in infants and toddlers is a good start, but there are a few areas that need improvement.
 
 To strengthen your argument, consider providing more specific examples from the text to support your claims about the cognitive development of infants and toddlers. For instance, you could discuss how movement and play help children develop problem-solving skills, hand-eye coordination, and spatial awareness.
 When discussing the role of caregiver involvement, try to provide more nuanced suggestions for caregivers. Instead of simply stating that caregivers should be present but not intrusive, consider offering specific strategies for balancing support with independence. For example, you could suggest that caregivers engage in activities alongside their child, but also give them space to explore and learn on their own.
 To improve your comparison of different types of play, try to provide more detailed explanations of each type. For instance, you could discuss how imaginative play helps children develop social skills, such as cooperation and communication, and how creative activities like drawing promote self-expression and confidence. By providing more specific examples and explanations, you can help to clarify the importance of each type of play and argue more effectively for their value.","### FEEDBACK: ANALYZING MOVEMENT AND PLAY

 Make Compound Interest Work for You with the TI-84 Plus
 Hopefully, you have the hang of entering values into the TVM Solver on your TI-84 Plus calculator. It might be a good idea to get a little more practice. In this exercise, you get to see what happens when compound interest is working for you rather than against you.
 In this example, use the TVM Solver to answer this question:
 You make a new year‚Äôs resolution to give up your daily trip to the coffee shop where you spend about $5 a day. Instead, you decide to save the money in a cookie jar and make an end-of-the-year investment of $1,825 in a growth stock mutual fund. If the mutual fund gets a 10% return a year (consider it compounded yearly), how long will it take for you to become a millionaire?
 Step 1. Access the TVM Solver
 Follow this step to access the TVM Solver: Press [APPS][ENTER][ENTER] to access the TVM Solver.
 Step 2. Enter values for five of the six TVM variables
 Here are the steps to enter values for five of the variables.
 How long will it take to become a millionaire? That is the question you are trying to answer. You aren't allowed to leave a field blank, so just leave the default value of 0.
 10% is entered as 10.
 The present value in this problem is 0.
 Remember, a cash outflow is considered a negative value. Enter the amount you are investing each year as a negative number, ‚Äì1825. Alternatively, you could enter the expression ‚Äì(5*365) and your calculator will evaluate the expression when you use the down-arrow key or press [ENTER] to advance to the next field.
 The future value is your financial goal, $1,000,000. Notice, this number is entered as a positive number because it is a cash inflow. Of course, don‚Äôt use commas or the $ sign when entering the number.
 Enter P/Y and C/Y.
 Enter 1 for the number of payments per year.
 Highlight PMT: END or BEGIN.
 Payment is made at the end of the year in this problem. Use the left- and right-arrow keys to move your cursor to END, and press [ENTER] to highlight. See the first screen.
 Step 3. Solve for the missing TVM variable
 Look back at what the question is asking: How long will it take to become a millionaire?
 You use the up- and down-arrow keys to place your cursor on the value you would like to solve for and press [ALPHA][ENTER]. So, move the cursor to the N value and press [ALPHA][ENTER]. See the second screen. Notice the small box next to the N value, indicating that you solved for that variable.
 Were you surprised at the result? In a little over 42 years, you could be a millionaire! \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Calculate a colleague's potential retirement savings using a growth stock mutual fund and the TI-84 Plus TVM Solver.
 
 Assume your colleague invests a fixed yearly amount of $2,500 and expects a 7% annual return compounded yearly, with the payment made at the end of the year and one payment per year.
 Enter values for the TVM variables and use the solver to calculate the savings after 35 years. Use the TVM Solver to find out how much your colleague would need to invest each year to reach a financial goal of $750,000 after 30 years with the same annual return and compounding frequency.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 {'N': 35, 'I%': 7, 'PV': 0, 'PMT': -2500, 'FV': 0, 'P/Y': 1, 'C/Y': 1, 'END/ BEGIN': END}",No,"### FEEDBACK: 
 
 **Assignment 1:**
 
 * You correctly utilized the TVM Solver to calculate the number of years it would take to become a millionaire with a 10% annual return.
 * The correct values for the TVM variables were entered, including the present value, investment amount, future value, interest rate, number of payments per year, and compounding frequency.
 * The payment schedule was set to occur at the end of the year, as specified in the problem.
 
 **Assignment 2:**
 
 * You were able to calculate the annual investment required to reach a financial goal of $750,000 after 30 years with a 7% annual return.
 * The TVM Solver was used effectively to find the solution.
 * The correct values for the TVM variables were entered, including the present value, interest rate, annual payment, future value, number of payments per year, and compounding frequency.
 
 **Suggestions for Improvement:**
 
 * Consider using the `=` key to enter the interest rate and annual payment instead of the `I%` and `PMT` variables.
 * Double-check the values for the TVM variables to ensure accuracy and consistency.
 * Use the `=` key to enter the annual payment and interest rate, as it is more efficient and reduces the risk of errors.
 
 **Grade:** 
 
 * 92% (Assignment 1: 90%, Assignment 2: 92%)
 
 **Note:** 
 
 * The grade is based on the completeness and accuracy of the assignments.
 * The feedback is provided to help you improve your skills and address any areas of concern.
 * Please review the feedback and make any necessary adjustments to your work.","### FEEDBACK: 
 Your solution is mostly correct, but there are a couple of areas that need improvement.
 
 You correctly identified the variables and their values, but you didn't actually solve the problem. To solve the problem, you need to use the TVM Solver to calculate the savings after 35 years and the amount needed to invest each year to reach a financial goal of $750,000 after 30 years.
 You didn't actually calculate the savings after 35 years. To do this, you need to press [ENTER] to advance to the next field and then press [ENTER] again to calculate the value of N. You should also calculate the amount needed to invest each year to reach a financial goal of $750,000 after 30 years.",B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
 Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, often abbreviated ACDF, is a commonly performed procedure for treatment of cervical spine (neck) disorders. An ACDF is usually performed to treat a degenerated or herniated disc in the neck. Disc degeneration and herniation are two common disc-related problems that may compress spinal nerve roots or the spinal cord that resides within the spinal canal.
 Compression or pinching of these neurologic structures may result in neck, shoulder, upper back, and arm pain. Other neurologic symptoms may include numbness, tingling and weakness in the arms or hands. The goal of an ACDF is to decompress the nerve root(s) and spinal cord, stabilize the neck, relieve symptoms, and enable the patient to return to regular activities of daily living.
 Anterior = front
 The surgical incision is made in the front of the neck either on the left or right side. The incision can often be performed within a natural skin crease or skin fold helping to conceal the surgical incision when healed and provide a pleasing cosmetic result.
 Cervical = neck
 The cervical levels are one region of the spine. There are seven vertebral bodies in the neck; numbered C1 (top) through C7 (bottom). The disc levels are also abbreviated. For example, C3-C4 refers to the intervertebral disc between the third and fourth cervical vertebral bodies (bones).
 Discectomy = to remove the disc
 Through the incision, the surgeon moves soft tissues aside to reveal the disc. Using special instruments, the surgeon removes the ruptured disc from between the upper and lower vertebral bodies.
 Fusion = to join or combine
 Bone graft is inserted into the empty space between the upper and lower vertebral bodies. Instrumentation (cervical plate and screws) is implanted to immobilize (stabilize) the neck. The body‚Äôs natural healing processes cause new bone to grow into and around the instrumentation resulting in a spinal fusion.
 Not every patient with a cervical degenerative disc problem or disc herniation requires spine surgery. Dr. Stieber may recommend an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion for the following reasons: if non-operative treatment fails to relieve symptoms, progressive worsening of neurologic symptoms or pain, spinal instability, and/or neurological problems. Numbness, loss of function, and weakness are examples of neurologic dysfunction.
 About Cervical Discectomy
 ACDF is performed under general anesthesia. The neck is cleansed and prepared for surgery. An incision is made on the left or right side of the neck. Muscles and other tissues are gently pulled aside to expose the disc. Dr. Stieber uses fluoroscopy, a type of real time x-ray during surgery. A thin needle is inserted into the disc, which can be viewed on fluoroscopy. Specialized surgical instruments are used to remove the ruptured disc. A spreader instrument gently separates the vertebral bodies while the disc and smaller disc pieces are removed. Disc material and bone spurs (osteophytes) that compress (pinch) spinal nerve roots are carefully removed. Bone graft fills the empty space after discectomy.
 Types of Bone Graft
 ‚óè Autograft is the patient‚Äôs own bone; usually taken from the hip.
 ‚óè Allograft is donor bone from a bone bank.
 ‚óè Bone graft substitute; there are different types, some of which are synthetic (man-made) and available in different shapes.
 Screws affix a metal plate over the bone graft. The plate holds the graft in place and stabilizes the neck. Although fluoroscopy is used during ACDF, a post-operative x-ray is taken to ensure the bone graft and instrumentation is well-positioned.
 After surgery, the patient is moved into the recovery area. In recovery, nurses and other members of the medical team closely monitor the patient‚Äôs vital signs ‚Äì pulse, respiration, blood pressure, and pain. Some post-operative pain should be expected and patients receive pain medication either through their IV (intravenous line) or by mouth.
 ‚óè A post-operative cervical brace may be prescribed to wear for a period after surgery to help immobilize and support the neck while healing.
 ‚óè Many patients go home the same day as surgery. Dr. Stieber discusses the likelihood of hospitalization with patients before their surgery date.
 Pre and post operative x-rays of a 49 year old female who was treated with an ACDF
 After Care at Home
 Dr. Stieber provides ACDF patients with information about what to expect and self-care after hospital discharge. This information includes instructions to control pain, medications, diet and managing constipation, bathing and incision care, activity restrictions, and the surgical follow-up appointments. As always, Dr. Stieber and his staff welcome questions and ensure that all patient concerns are thoroughly addressed. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Imagine you're Dr. Stieber's patient and are about to undergo an Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF) surgery. Write a letter to a family member describing what will happen during the surgery and what you can expect during your recovery at home.
 
 Explain the term ACDF and what each part of the abbreviation means.
 Describe the procedure for removing the ruptured disc and what happens to the empty space afterwards.
 Outline the steps you'll take to control pain and manage your daily activities after being discharged from the hospital.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 Dear Mom,
 During my surgery, Dr. Stieber will be performing an Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF). This is a big phrase, but it can be broken down into smaller parts. 'Anterior' refers to the front of my neck, which is where Dr. Stieber will make the incision. 'Cervical' refers to my neck, which is the region of my spine that will be operated on. 'Discectomy' means that Dr. Stieber will be removing the ruptured disc from between my vertebrae. Finally, 'Fusion' means that he will be joining together my vertebrae using a bone graft and a metal plate to stabilize my neck.
 To remove the ruptured disc, Dr. Stieber will make an incision in the front of my neck and gently move aside the soft tissues to reveal the disc. He will then use specialized instruments to remove the disc and any bone spurs that may be compressing my spinal nerve roots. After the disc is removed, he will insert a bone graft into the empty space to help my vertebrae fuse together. A metal plate will be attached to my vertebrae using screws to hold the bone graft in place and stabilize my neck.
 After I'm discharged from the hospital, I'll need to take it easy and avoid heavy lifting, bending, or strenuous activities. I'll need to take pain medication as directed by Dr. Stieber to manage my pain, and I'll need to follow a bowel regimen to prevent constipation. I'll also need to wear a cervical brace to help immobilize and support my neck while it heals. I'll need to follow up with Dr. Stieber for post-operative appointments to ensure that my neck is healing properly.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Your letter provides a good overview of the ACDF procedure and what to expect during recovery. However, there are a few areas that need improvement.
 
 To make your letter more concise, consider breaking up the long sentence about the ACDF procedure into two separate sentences. This will make it easier for your mom to understand the different parts of the procedure.
 When explaining the bowel regimen, try to be more specific about what to expect. For example, you could mention that you'll need to take a specific type of medication to prevent constipation, or that you'll need to follow a specific diet to help move food through your digestive system. This will help your mom understand what to expect and how to support you during recovery.","### FEEDBACK: Assignment Submission
 
 **Content and Clarity: 9/10**
 Your letter effectively explains the concept of ACDF and its procedure. You break down the complex terms into smaller parts, making it easier for the reader to understand. However, there are a few areas where you could improve the clarity and concision of your writing.
 
 **Organization and Structure: 8.5/10**
 Your letter follows a logical structure, starting with an introduction to the ACDF procedure, followed by a detailed explanation of the steps involved, and concluding with post-operative instructions. However, consider adding more transitional phrases to connect your ideas and improve the flow of your writing.
 
 **Grammar and Mechanics: 9.5/10**
 Your writing is generally free of grammatical errors, with only a few minor typos and punctuation mistakes. However, proofread your work carefully to ensure that your letter is error-free.

 - The peach tree is considered to be the tree of life and peaches are symbols of immortality and unity. Peach blossoms are carried by Chinese brides.
 - The Romans called the peaches ‚ÄúPersian Apples‚Äù naming them after the country that introduced peaches to the West.
 - Spaniards brought peaches to South America and the French introduced them to Louisiana. The English took them to their Jamestown and Massachusetts colonies. Columbus brought peach trees to America on his second and third voyages.
 - China is the largest world producer of peaches, with Italy second.
 - California produces more than 50% of the peaches in the United States (and grows 175 different varieties).
 - So many peaches are grown in Georgia that it became known as the Peach State.
 - True wild peaches are only found in China. Unlike the cultivated fruit, the wild fruit is small, sour and very fuzzy.
 - Peaches are available for u-picking at many Arizona farms including Schnepf Farms, Apple Annie‚Äôs Orchards, Sphinx Date Ranch and more. The peach season in Arizona varies with the location of the farm, so check their website for picking season. To find a local u-pick farm go to fillyourplate.org.
 Nutrition and Facts
 - Peaches are a good source of vitamins A, B and C. A medium peach contains only 37 calories.
 - You can ripen peaches by placing them in a brown paper bag for two to three days. Sliced, fresh peaches should be tossed in lemon or lime juice to prevent browning.

 Your assignment showcases a comprehensive understanding of the cultural, historical, and botanical significance of peaches. Below, I provide feedback on your exhibit design and curatorial statement.
 
 **Exhibit Design:**
 Your multimedia exhibit is well-structured, and the inclusion of Chinese peach blossoms and associated art in the introduction section effectively sets the tone for the rest of the exhibit. The four display sections effectively break down the exhibit into manageable sections, allowing visitors to explore the peach's mystical attributes, historical significance, and botanical characteristics.
 
 However, consider adding more interactive elements to engage visitors and encourage deeper learning. For example, you could include a quiz or a game that tests visitors' knowledge of peach-related facts, or provide a ""design your own peach tree"" station where visitors can create their own peach tree using various materials.
 
 **Curatorial Statement:**
 Your curatorial statement provides a solid historical context for the peach's introduction to the West. You effectively highlight the peach's journey from 'Persian Apples' to the diverse varieties cultivated in the United States today.
 
 To further strengthen your statement, consider adding more specific details about the peach's cultural significance in Chinese culture. For example, you could explain how the peach tree is considered the ""tree of life"" and how peaches are symbols of immortality and unity. Additionally, you could discuss how the peach's introduction to the West was influenced by European colonization and trade.
 
 **Interactive Component:**
 Your interactive component is a great starting point, but consider adding more depth and complexity to illustrate the peach's botanical characteristics. For example, you could include a diagram or animation that shows how the peach is classified as a drupe and its membership in the rose family (Rosaceae).
 
 **Timeline:**
 Your visual timeline effectively charts the peach's migration from China to the Americas, but consider adding more key events and dates to make it more comprehensive. For example, you could include the establishment of peach cultivation in Japan and the development of new peach varieties in the United States.

 Analyzing Heart Development in Human Embryos
 
 Based on the provided information, describe the process of formation of the septum intermedium in the atrial canal of a human embryo, specifically explaining how it divides the canal into two channels and what structures these channels will eventually become.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 The septum intermedium is formed when the endocardial cushions project into the atrial canal and unite in the middle line. This division results in the creation of two channels: the future right and left atrioventricular orifices. Eventually, these channels will develop into the right and left atrioventricular openings, where the right one will become the tricuspid valve and mitral valve and the left channel will become the mitral valve and the pulmonary valve but is incorrect about it being just those two as it also refers to other incorrect information regarding comparisons of the other valve and one being incorrect.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: ANALYZING HEART DEVELOPMENT IN HUMAN EMBRYOS
 
 Your assignment provided an overview of the formation of the septum intermedium in the atrial canal of a human embryo. However, there are a few points that require clarification:
 
 * The statement ""the left channel will become the mitral valve and the pulmonary valve"" contains an error. The correct information is that the left channel will become the mitral valve and the left pulmonary valve. 
 * The description of the right atrioventricular orifice is incomplete. It should mention that it will eventually develop into the tricuspid valve and the right coronary sinus.
 * The information about the comparison between the other valve is not relevant to the question asked.
 
 To improve your understanding and provide a clear explanation, consider revisiting the provided Wikipedia information and focusing on the key points:
 
 * The endocardial cushions project into the atrial canal.
 * They unite in the middle line to form the septum intermedium.
 * This division results in the creation of two channels: the future right and left atrioventricular orifices.
 * These channels will eventually develop into the tricuspid valve and the mitral valve on the right, and the mitral valve and the pulmonary valve on the left.","### FEEDBACK: The explanation of the septum intermedium's formation and its division into channels is mostly correct, but there are some inaccuracies in the description of the structures these channels will eventually become.
 
 The statement about the left channel becoming the mitral valve and the pulmonary valve is incorrect. The correct information is that the left channel will become the mitral valve and the left pulmonary valve, not the pulmonary valve.
 The comparison of the tricuspid valve and mitral valve with the pulmonary valve is also incorrect. The correct information is that the tricuspid valve and mitral valve are part of the right atrioventricular orifice, and the pulmonary valve is part of the left atrioventricular orifice.",B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
 If you‚Äôve spent any time in the baking aisle picking out chocolate for your next baking endeavor, chances are you encountered a confusing variety of chocolate-related terms. What‚Äôs the difference between cocoa and cacao, or bittersweet and semisweet chocolate? Here is a brief guide to some of the most commonly misunderstood chocolate terms.
 Cocoa Bean Terms
 First, there are a few key cocoa bean terms you need to understand.
 Cocoa or cacao bean
 The cocoa, or cacao, bean, is the source from which chocolate is derived. These beans are found inside the fruit of the cacao tree in fleshy, oval-shaped pods and are then harvested, fermented, and dried. The important thing to keep in mind here is that the terms ‚Äúcocoa bean‚Äù and ‚Äúcacao bean‚Äù refer to the same bean. The terms ‚Äúcocoa‚Äù and ‚Äúcacao‚Äù alone, however, do carry some important differences. More on that later.
 Cocoa beans that have been fermented, dried, roasted, and separated from their skins are called cocoa nibs. Cocoa nibs are then ground into a thick paste, which is called chocolate liquor. Chocolate liquor contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in roughly equal proportion.
 Cocoa butter is the fatty component of the cocoa bean. It makes up 50 to 60 percent of the cocoa bean. Despite what its name might suggest, cocoa butter is dairy-free.
 Cocoa solids are the non-fat part of the cocoa bean. They make up 40 to 50 percent of the cocoa bean. They are typically ground up in order to create cocoa powder.
 Cocoa vs. Cacao
 According to U.S. regulations, the term ‚Äúcocoa‚Äù is actually used interchangeably with ‚Äúcocoa powder.‚Äù (Quick refresher: cocoa powder is made by grinding up cocoa solids, the non-fat part of the cocoa bean.) In addition, the term ‚Äúcocoa‚Äù may be used to designate products that are derived from roasted cocoa/cacao beans.
 The term ‚Äúcacao‚Äù is typically used to refer to any products that are derived from raw, unroasted cocoa beans, such as cacao nibs, cacao butter, cacao powder, and cacao paste. Unroasted beans contain more antioxidants and other essential nutrients than their roasted counterparts. That‚Äôs why you see the word ‚Äúcacao‚Äù all over health food stores. (According to this article, apparently some people use cacao powder as a stimulant drug. Yikes.)
 Dark vs. Vegan Chocolate
 There is no official definition for dark chocolate, but it is essentially a combination of cocoa, fat, and sugar. Traditionally, no milk solids are added, differentiating it from milk chocolate, but many varieties of dark chocolate do contain some milk solid additives. Dark chocolate is often distinguished by the percentage of cocoa solids in the bar, ranging from about 30 percent (sweet dark) to 80 percent (extremely dark).
 I‚Äôm including this here because a lot of people assume that all dark chocolate is vegan. Many dark chocolates, however, contain a variety of additives‚Äîsuch as milk, milk solids, or milk fat‚Äîwhich make pure chocolate no longer vegan. A vegan chocolate will typically contain only a short list of ingredients, such as cocoa, cocoa butter, lecithin, sugar, and vanilla. If you‚Äôre looking for a vegan chocolate, look for something that is dairy-free, whey-free, and casein-free.
 Bittersweet vs. Semisweet Chocolate
 Bittersweet chocolate is chocolate liquor with some sugar and more cocoa butter added. It usually also contains vanilla flavoring and may contain lecithin as well. Bittersweet chocolate typically has less sugar and more chocolate liquor than semisweet chocolate. When baking, however, bittersweet and semisweet chocolate are essentially interchangeable. Often, you will find the percentage of cocoa contained in bittersweet chocolate printed on the package; the higher the percentage, the less sweet the chocolate.
 Semisweet chocolate is chocolate liquor with some sugar and cocoa butter added. It usually contains more sugar than bittersweet chocolate, but since the terms ‚Äúbittersweet‚Äù and ‚Äúsemisweet‚Äù are not regulated, this is not always the case.
 Natural vs. Dutch Process Cocoa
 Natural cocoa powder is ground up cocoa solids. It contains naturally occurring acids, which is important to keep in mind when choosing a leavening ingredient in a baking recipe. Baking soda, for example, reacts with acid to make things rise, while baking powder contains acidic cream of tartar to make things rise.
 Dutch process cocoa
 Dutch process, or European style, cocoa has been treated to neutralize the naturally occurring acids. This lends Dutch process cocoa a mellower flavor and redder color.
 Other Chocolate Terms
 Unsweetened chocolate, or baking chocolate, is essentially chocolate liquor mixed with some form of fat to create a solid substance. It has a deep, rich chocolate flavor and is often combined with sugar to serve as a base in brownies, cakes, and cookies.
 Sweet baking chocolate
 Sweet chocolate is at least 15 percent pure chocolate and contains added sugar and cocoa butter. It is sweeter than semisweet chocolate.
 Milk chocolate is at least 10 percent pure chocolate, with added sugar, cocoa butter, and milk solids. It has a milder flavor than darker chocolates because it contains less pure chocolate. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Develop a hypothetical recipe for a vegan, sugar-reduced, high-cocoa-content dark chocolate cake that uses Dutch process cocoa powder and explains the reasoning behind each ingredient choice.
 
 Research and select the primary ingredients, such as cocoa content percentage and the type of sugar to use.
 Calculate and justify the exact amount of sugar required for the recipe, taking into consideration the cocoa content of the dark chocolate used.
 Explain why Dutch process cocoa powder was chosen for this specific recipe, considering the chemical composition of the cake.
 Choose and explain any potential substitutes or leavening agents to ensure that the cake reacts correctly with the Dutch process cocoa powder, taking into account the pH level of the ingredients used.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 Imagine you are a talented pastry chef and have developed a recipe for a sugar-reduced, high-cocoa-content dark chocolate cake using Dutch process cocoa powder that serves 8 people. The recipe is as follows: ingredients include 1 1/2 sticks of Earth Balance vegan butter, softened, 1 cup of coconut sugar, 1/2 cup of date syrup, 4 large egg replacers, 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, 1 1/4 cups of almond flour, 1 cup of Dutch process cocoa powder, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, and 1 cup of non-dairy buttermilk. To prepare the cake, preheat the oven to 350¬∞F (180¬∞C). Grease two 8-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Using an electric mixer, cream together the vegan butter and coconut sugar until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes. Beat in the date syrup, egg replacers, and vanilla extract. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the almond flour, cocoa powder, and salt. In a small bowl, whisk together the baking soda and non-dairy buttermilk. Add to the cake mixture and mix until just combined. Split the batter evenly between the prepared pans and smooth out the tops. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool in pans for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely. To assemble the cake, melt 1 cup of high-cocoa-content dark chocolate chips with 1 tablespoon of non-dairy butter in a double boiler. Place one cake layer on a serving plate, spread a thin layer of the melted chocolate on top, and place the second cake layer on top. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining melted chocolate. Serve immediately.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Assignments
 
 Your hypothetical recipe for a vegan, sugar-reduced, high-cocoa-content dark chocolate cake showcases a good understanding of various chocolate terms. Here are a few observations and suggestions for improvement:
 
 * **Ingredient Selection:** Your choice of using Dutch process cocoa powder is correct, as it helps neutralize the naturally occurring acids in the cocoa powder, which is beneficial for baking. However, it's worth noting that Dutch process cocoa can have a milder flavor compared to natural cocoa powder.
 * **Sugar Reduction:** You've successfully reduced the amount of sugar in the recipe by using coconut sugar and date syrup. This is a great approach, but be aware that the flavor profile may vary depending on the specific brands and types of sugar used.
 * **Leavening Agents:** Your selection of baking soda as a leavening agent is appropriate, considering the pH level of the ingredients used. However, it's worth noting that baking soda can react with acidic ingredients, so make sure to balance the pH levels in your recipe.
 * **Cake Texture:** The addition of non-dairy buttermilk and egg replacers should help maintain a moist texture in the cake. However, keep an eye on the cake's texture during baking, as overmixing can lead to a dense cake.
 
 **Suggestions for Improvement:**
 
 * Consider adding a note about the importance of using high-quality chocolate chips with a high cocoa content to maintain the desired flavor profile.
 * When working with Dutch process cocoa powder, it's essential to note that it can affect the pH levels in the recipe. Be sure to balance the pH levels by using ingredients like baking soda or lemon juice.
 * To ensure a smooth frosting, make sure to melt the chocolate chips slowly and temper them to achieve a stable crystal structure.
 
 Overall, your recipe demonstrates a good understanding of various chocolate terms and ingredient selection. With a few tweaks and adjustments, you can refine your recipe to achieve a delicious and moist dark chocolate cake.","### FEEDBACK: Your recipe for a sugar-reduced, high-cocoa-content dark chocolate cake using Dutch process cocoa powder is creative and well-structured. However, there are a few areas that need improvement.
 
 To ensure the cake reacts correctly with the Dutch process cocoa powder, you should consider the pH level of the ingredients used. Dutch process cocoa powder is alkalized, which means it has a higher pH level than natural cocoa powder. To balance this, you could add a small amount of lemon juice or vinegar to the recipe to adjust the pH level. Additionally, you may want to consider using a pH test strip to ensure the batter has a pH level that is suitable for the Dutch process cocoa powder.
 To make the recipe more accurate, you should specify the type of sugar to use. While coconut sugar and date syrup are both natural sweeteners, they have different properties and uses. Coconut sugar has a lower glycemic index than refined sugar, but it also has a stronger flavor. Date syrup, on the other hand, has a rich, caramel-like flavor. To make the recipe more versatile, you could specify that the sugar should be a natural sweetener with a low glycemic index, such as coconut sugar or honey.",B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Wyoming ‚Äî History and Culture
 Few other states in America embody the attitude and atmosphere of the working cowboy as much as Wyoming. This rugged, remote territory got its start with cattle ranching, but eventually added leisure tourism to its economy when the world‚Äôs first national park was established at Yellowstone. Wyoming is a four-season travel destination, with great skiing at Jackson Hole and plenty of summer outdoor adventure in the Tetons and Wind River Range. The folks here have found a way to merge their cowboy traditions with the tourist dollar by transforming dozens of huge ranches into guest ranches where visitors can live out their dreams of being a cowboy (or cowgirl) for a few days.
 Several major Native American tribes lived in Wyoming prior to the arrival of the first Europeans. The Lakota, Shoshone, Crow, and Arapaho were the largest tribes living here and today, the Lakota and Shoshone share a huge Indian reservation in the Wind River Valley. They hold many sites in Wyoming as sacred, including Devils Tower and the Grand Tetons.
 Though French fur trappers were the first Europeans into the area, the Lewis and Clark Expedition led by John Colter and his Shoshone wife Sacagawea reached Wyoming in 1807. Their initial reports of Yellowstone were considered to be fictional, but the discovery of South Pass in 1812 allowed the Oregon Trail to continue over the mountains into the Pacific Northwest. In 1850 Jim Bridger discovered Bridger Pass, which was later used by the Union Pacific Railroad in 1868 and again by Interstate 80 to help travelers get through the dense Rocky Mountains.
 When the Union Pacific Railroad reached the city of Cheyenne in 1867, Wyoming really began to open up to immigration and trade. The Wyoming Territory was established by the US government that same year. After endless speculation over the reality of Yellowstone‚Äôs natural wonders, enough people finally witnessed the place to encourage the US government to create the world‚Äôs first national park in 1872.
 Wyoming has been a progressive state from the start. In 1869, its governor granted women the right to vote in local elections, making Wyoming the first US state to allow women‚Äôs suffrage. The state boasts the country‚Äôs first female governor (in 1924), an event which earned it the nickname the Equality State.
 The early economy was based largely around cattle ranching, and the state still has a sizeable dude ranch sector. This has evolved into tourism revenue with the creation of guest ranches that allow visitors to experience cowboy life without any of the hardships. Yellowstone National Park helped open up the West to the concept of leisure travel, with tourism further expanded in the state when the Grand Tetons were developed into the ski area of Jackson Hole and Grand Tetons National Park. Tourism remains an essential component of Wyoming‚Äôs economy.
 Wyoming‚Äôs nickname, the Cowboy State, perfectly describes the prevailing vibe of this true grit Western territory. Genuine cattle ranches with working cowboys can be seen throughout Wyoming, and even many newcomers have eagerly adopted the cowboy wannabe look and attitude. The residents of Wyoming are strong, independent people who live off the land and greatly respect it. This isn‚Äôt a place where cosmopolitan affairs concern many folks, but the locals are very welcoming to the millions of tourists who come each year to experience the beauty and cowboy culture of their state.
 Besides this ranching environment, Wyoming is a haven for hardcore outdoor enthusiasts. The town of Jackson Hole is where most of them gravitate, thanks to its extremely challenging ski terrain and world-class rock climbing and mountaineering. These young adrenalin junkies make up the other main demographic of Wyoming, adding a welcome splash of color and energy to the traditional conservatism of the cowboys. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Analyze how Wyoming's progression from a ranching-based economy to a tourism-driven economy has impacted the state's cultural identity.
 
 Explain how the establishment of Yellowstone National Park and the development of guest ranches influenced Wyoming's shift towards tourism.
 Discuss the role of ranching and cowboy culture in shaping Wyoming's cultural identity, and how this has been affected by the growing presence of outdoor enthusiasts and tourists.

 CAAV member and former steering committee chair Les Grady presented a talk about climate change at the Massanutten Regional Library, downtown Harrisonburg, on Monday, April 20, 2015, entitled Help! My Planet‚Äôs in Trouble and I Don‚Äôt Know What to Do.
 The Daily News-Record‚Äòs Elaina Sauber was there along with photographer Nikki Fox. The below article was published in the Daily News-Record on Tuesday, April 21, 2015.
 Climate Change Talk Hopes to Educate
 by Elaina Sauber
 HARRISONBURG ‚Äì Les Grady thinks the first step to slowing down climate change is simply talking about it.
 ‚ÄúBringing up climate change in a polite society stops the conversation,‚Äù said Grady, member of the steering committee for the advocacy group Climate Action Alliance of the Valley. ‚ÄúWe just don‚Äôt want to think about it, because we feel really helpless.‚Äù
 The licensed professional engineer, who has taught environmental engineering at Purdue and Clemson universities, spoke to about 30 people Monday about addressing and alleviating the effects of climate change to commemorate Earth Day, which is Wednesday. The event was held at Massanutten Regional Library‚Äôs main branch in Harrisonburg.
 Grady has also worked part time for the last two decades for CH2MHILL, the world‚Äôs largest environmental engineering consulting firm.
 While 97 percent of climate scientists agree that warming trends of the last century are likely due to human activities, he said, a new study from Yale University shows that only 52 percent of Americans are concerned about climate change.
 Skeptics argue that the Earth experiences natural shifts in climate, and any perceived changes aren‚Äôt being driven by the burning of fossil fuels.
 Grady said the first thing to recognize when it comes to climate change is that a variety of research sources confirm its existence ‚Äì not just temperature records.
 ‚ÄúIn fact, temperature records are probably the least reliable in the sense of indicators,‚Äù he added, due to natural variability and the fact that only about 1 percent of the Earth‚Äôs heat is in the atmosphere.
 The oceans contain most of the planet‚Äôs heat. According to research from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, oceans‚Äô heat content has risen almost continually since the mid-1990s.
 Accepting climate change as reality also means accepting the role carbon dioxide plays in exacerbating it, Grady said.
 As rising carbon dioxide levels contribute to higher temperatures, precipitation and sea levels also increase, Grady said.
 ‚ÄúThe more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the warmer it‚Äôs going to be,‚Äù he said.
 Developing countries in Africa, South America and Indonesia are more vulnerable to issues stemming from climate change because they don‚Äôt have the economic resources to deal with the problems it presents, Grady said.
 ‚ÄúMany people say this is a moral and ethical question, because their contributions to the problem are negligible ‚Äì they haven‚Äôt emitted very much carbon dioxide,‚Äù Grady said.
 Grady listed steps people can take to help address climate change in their own lives.
 In Virginia, he said, transportation is the major source of carbon dioxide emissions, followed by electricity generation through the burning of coal. While anyone can make changes to their transportation and electricity use, Grady said the political process is crucial in persuading energy providers to follow suit.
 ‚ÄúWe as citizens need to be active,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúState electric generators really have not done very much, nor are they planning to, about this problem.‚Äù
 He also encouraged attendees to calculate their carbon footprint using programs found on the Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs website.
 But the main course of action Grady advocates is implementing a carbon fee and dividend.
 ‚ÄúWe allow all of us to dump the waste from burning fossil fuels into the atmosphere,‚Äù he said.
 A better solution, he said, is to charge households a fee commensurate with the impact of their carbon footprint, ‚Äúso that when we buy it, we‚Äôre not socializing those costs anymore; they become privatized, just like the profits are.‚Äù

 A new network diagram function has been added to Heurist that allows you to view the schema of relationships within the database, as well as the network of connections between the records in a search result set. It also allows export of network data to GEPHI for further manipulation.
 The new tool is a good way for researchers to explore and understand their data structure and content visually. By dragging nodes into position and interactively modifying the shape and colours of the diagram elements, a researcher can sometimes reveal hidden properties and patterns or isolate anomalies within the data. Clicking on either the nodes or the lines pops up information on the connectivity between them (pointer fields, relationships, counts).
 The Data Summary function uses a network diagram to display an interactive visualisation of the record relationships schema, that is the structure defined by pointer fields and relationships specified through relationship marker fields. These fields constrain the target record types and thus define the relationships structure of the database.
 The Summary table on the left is a useful overview of the counts for each record type, and can be used to open a new tab with a search for a specific record type. Record types displayed in the network diagram can be turned on and off; the diagram remembers the selected record types and their position in the diagram between uses, so that the diagram is re-displayed the way you left it.
 The direction of relationships between entities (record types) is shown with arrows, and the frequency of occurrence in the database is indicated by line thickness, which may be weighted to linear or log scales. The frequency of occurrence of each record type is shown by the radius of the node, which may also be linear or log scaled.
 The nodes representing record types can be dragged to restructure the diagram; with gravity enabled, other nodes will settle into position.
 Settings include line thickness, node radius and colours, and ‚Äògravity‚Äô settings (which govern how the diagram behaves when entities are moved). There‚Äôs also a fisheye mode, mostly just for fun. Setting curved lines allows one to separately view relationships which go in opposite directions, which would otherwise appear as a single line with arrows in both directions.
 You can view information about a particular record type (pointer and relationship marker fields, with use counts) by clicking on a node.
 Network visualisation is also available through the ‚ÄúConnections‚Äù tab in the righthand panel of the search screen. This diagram shows the records in the current result-set as nodes, and the connections (pointer fields and relationships) as the lines between nodes (edges).
 This diagram provides the same controls as the database schema diagram.
 For both types of diagram you can export the data to a Gephi GEFX file via the Gephi button at top-right.
 Gephi is a widely used free, open-source desktop tool that gives great flexibility in the visualisation of networks. Further information and download of Gephi is available here.
 Once you have installed Gephi, clicking on the exported Gephi file will open the data in Gephi, where you have a wide range of options for tailoring and exporting similar diagrams. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Network Visualisation Assignment
 
 Imagine you are a researcher studying a large dataset of book authors, publishers, and genres. Describe a scenario where using Heurist's network diagram function would help you discover hidden patterns or anomalies in the data, and how you would further explore these findings using Gephi.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 Suppose I'm investigating the writing careers of mystery novel authors and their associated book genres, publishers, and collaborations. I apply Heurist's network diagram to search results for 'Mystery Authors.' On the diagram, I notice an unusual cluster of highly interconnected authors who published via a relatively unknown publishing house. Heurist also brings to my attention several anomalies relative to all the other authors in the set - specifically, only one author in the group produced 89% of their publications in the 1980s and an alarming number of book genres, especially given the short relative writing period of the group's originator. To understand this behavior, I utilize Gephi by exporting the findings to a GEFX file. With Gephi's refined manipulations, I determine that this publishing house focused on specific book genres in the 1980s and established strategic alliances with various authors. It could also show possible co-author collaborations that wouldn't be immediately visible otherwise. On the other hand, I incorrectly assume all publishing houses have no constraints on book genres, ignore turning on dragable node positions to show clearer groupings and ignore turning on dragable node positions to show clearer groupings, especially to highlight adamantly unique authors within this group turning on dragable node positions to show clearer groupings, especially to highlight adamantly unique authors turning on dragable node positions dragable node positions to show clearer groupings, especially to highlight adamantly unique authors within this group, especially.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Good start on applying Heurist's network diagram function to a research scenario, but there are areas for improvement.
 
 You correctly identified a scenario where Heurist's network diagram function would help discover hidden patterns or anomalies in the data. However, you could have provided more details on how you would use the diagram to explore these findings.
 You mentioned utilizing Gephi to further explore the findings, but you could have provided more specific examples of how you would use Gephi's features to refine the manipulations and gain a deeper understanding of the data.
 You incorrectly assumed that all publishing houses have no constraints on book genres, which is not necessarily true. You should have considered the possibility that some publishing houses may have specific genre focuses or constraints.
 You mentioned turning on dragable node positions to show clearer groupings, but you could have provided more details on how you would use this feature to highlight unique authors within the group.","### FEEDBACK: 
 
 Your assignment demonstrates a clear understanding of Heurist's network diagram function and its potential in discovering hidden patterns or anomalies in the data. Here are some areas for improvement:
 
 * You could have explored more specific details about how Heurist's network diagram function helps in visualizing the relationships between authors, publishers, and genres. For instance, you could have mentioned the use of node radius to show the frequency of occurrence of each record type or the line thickness to indicate the direction of relationships.
 * In your scenario, you correctly identified an unusual cluster of interconnected authors and anomalies in the data. However, you could have provided more clarity on how you would further explore these findings using Gephi. For example, you could have mentioned specific Gephi features or manipulations that would help you understand the behavior of the publishing house or the co-author collaborations.
 * There are some minor errors in your assignment, such as the repeated mention of ""dragable node positions"" and the incomplete sentence about highlighting unique authors. Make sure to proofread your work carefully before submitting it.
 
 ### RECOMMENDATIONS:
 
 * To improve your understanding of Heurist's network diagram function, try experimenting with different settings and features, such as node radius, line thickness, and gravity settings.
 * When exploring your findings using Gephi, focus on specific features or manipulations that would help you understand the behavior of the publishing house or the co-author collaborations.
 * Make sure to proofread your work carefully before submitting it to avoid minor errors.
 
 ### NEXT STEPS:
 
 * Practice using Heurist's network diagram function to visualize different types of relationships in your data.
 * Experiment with Gephi to refine your understanding of network visualizations and their potential applications.
 * Apply your knowledge of Heurist and Gephi to real-world scenarios or case studies to develop your critical thinking and problem-solving skills.",A,Answer starts to repeat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Debunking Myths About Summer Camp
 In This Article:
 3. My child should attend sleepaway camp with a friend or a sibling.
 Sending your child to camp with a buddy is a tricky decision, and you should weigh all facts carefully before coming to a conclusion. First, remember that what works for a friend or a sibling won't necessarily work for your child. When choosing a camp, keep your child's needs in mind and don't automatically assume that he will be happy where his friends are. Also, camp presents an entirely unknown social stratosphere. Old, familiar relationships may take on new characteristics within a fresh context, which can cause tension between friends. Consider also that your child may be ready to explore different elements of his character at camp. Perhaps he wishes to come out of his shell and try being friendly and outgoing, rather than the shy student he is at school. Surrounded by familiar faces, he may be bogged down by his customary role and feel unable to develop.
 4. My special needs child has no camp options.
 These days, camp is for everyone. Developmentally disabled children can choose from numerous options and enjoy a wonderful time at summer camp. Children with ADHD, dyslexia, learning disorders, and physical and mental handicaps can benefit from working with counselors who are trained to help them. Your child will welcome the opportunity to spend time with other children and participate in summer camp activities. Be sure to do detailed research on facilities and staff.
 More on: Summer Camp \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Critically evaluate the claim that children should attend sleepaway camps with friends or siblings. Support your argument with theoretical perspectives and/ or practical examples. Examine the potential drawbacks of this approach, including impact on the childrens personal development, and compare/contrast how it harmonizes with/ or differentiates from benefits presented.
 
 Research and gather academic evidence on the importance of independence in personal development theory
 Using the text, identify an alternative approach that may help children discover new aspects of themselves
 Consider an alternative setting where this alternative approach can benefit a child more
 Create a conclusion summarizing your stance
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 Attending sleepaway camp with friends or siblings may hinder personal development as it could prevent children from gaining independence. According to Erik Erikson's psychosocial development theory, children need to establish their own identities (Erikson, 1963). Being surrounded by familiar faces can stifle this development. An alternative approach is to allow children to participate in activities freely, without influence from old relationships. This can help children discover new aspects of themselves. A setting such as a day camp with diverse activities and group rotations could benefit a child more than a sleepaway camp. Conclusion: It is generally not beneficial for children to attend sleepaway camp with friends or siblings. References: Erikson, Erik H. (1963). Childhood and society. New York: Norton & Company.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: 
 
 Overall, your assignment demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and the theoretical perspectives involved. However, there are a few areas where you can improve:
 
 1. **Clearer thesis statement**: Your conclusion could be more concise and directly address the question. For example, ""Attending sleepaway camp with friends or siblings can hinder personal development due to the potential stunted independence and social constraints it presents.""
 
 2. **More specific examples**: While you mention Erik Erikson's theory, you could provide more concrete examples of how sleepaway camps with friends or siblings might hinder independence and personal development.
 
 3. **Alternative approach explanation**: You suggest allowing children to participate in activities freely without influence from old relationships. However, you could elaborate on how this approach can facilitate discovery and growth.
 
 4. **Day camp explanation**: You propose a day camp with diverse activities and group rotations as an alternative setting. Consider explaining why this setting is more beneficial for a child's development.
 
 5. **Reference formatting**: You use a single space between the reference and the reference text, which is not in line with standard formatting.","### FEEDBACK: Your argument is well-supported by Erik Erikson's psychosocial development theory, and you effectively highlight the potential drawbacks of attending sleepaway camp with friends or siblings. However, there are a couple of areas for improvement.
 
 To strengthen your argument, consider incorporating additional theoretical perspectives, such as Jean Piaget's cognitive development theory or Urie Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of personal development in children.
 When referencing Erik Erikson's work, ensure that you accurately attribute the specific theory or concept being referenced. In this case, you correctly referenced Erikson's psychosocial development theory, but it would be beneficial to provide more context or clarify which stage of the theory is most relevant to your argument.",B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Sepsis is the body‚Äôs overwhelming and life-threatening response to infection. It can lead to tissue damage, organ failure and death.
 The source of infection could be from any number of causes, such as an animal bite, common cold that turns to pneumonia, open wound, urinary tract infection, an implanted device, stomach bug, post-surgery infection, meningitis, kidney infection, bacteria that enters the blood, to name a few.
 What are the symptoms?
 Symptoms include fever, chills or sweats, extreme body aches, confusion, shortness of breath and rapid heart rate.
 If you or someone you know are experiencing these symptoms, call your doctor.
 Go to the Emergency Department if:
 - You feel sick, very tired, weak and achy
 - Your heartbeat or breathing is very fast
 - Temperature is above 101.5 or below 96.8
 - Fingernails are pale or blue
 - People say you aren‚Äôt making sense
 - You have a wound that is painful, red, smells or has pus

 Design a Sepsis Awareness Campaign for a Local Hospital.
 
 Based on the provided text, identify the most effective ways to convey the urgency and severity of sepsis symptoms to the general public for your campaign.
 Explain how you plan to incorporate the message 'Time is everything in getting treated with the right antibiotics' into your campaign's messaging and visual elements.
 Develop a concise slogan that captures the essence of your campaign's goals and effectively raises awareness about sepsis.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 For task_1, I would suggest using a mix of print and social media advertising to convey the urgency and severity of sepsis symptoms. For example, 'Don't Wait, Act Fast' or 'Sepsis: Time is of the Essence' could be used as headlines in our campaign's print ads, while 'Sepsis: Know the Signs, Act Fast' could be used as a social media post. For task_2, I would incorporate the message into our campaign's visual elements, such as a countdown timer or a hourglass, to visually represent the urgency of seeking treatment for sepsis. For task_3, a potential slogan could be 'Beat the Clock, Beat Sepsis.'",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Your campaign ideas show promise, but there are areas for improvement.
 
 For task_1, consider adding more specific details on how you plan to use print and social media advertising, such as targeting specific demographics or using eye-catching visuals to grab attention.
 For task_2, think about how you can make the message more relatable and personal, such as using a real-life story or testimonial to illustrate the importance of seeking treatment quickly.
 For task_3, try to come up with a slogan that is more concise and memorable, such as 'Sepsis: Act Fast, Live Longer' or 'Don't Wait, Save a Life.'","### FEEDBACK: 
 
 **Task 1:**
 Your suggestion to use a mix of print and social media advertising is effective in reaching a broader audience. However, consider incorporating more visual elements, such as images or videos, to grab the attention of potential viewers. For example, a person experiencing sepsis symptoms, with a timer counting down in the background, would be a powerful visual representation of the urgency.
 
 **Task 2:**
 Using a countdown timer or hourglass is a creative way to visually represent the urgency of seeking treatment for sepsis. To further emphasize this message, consider incorporating a 'time-sensitive' color scheme, such as red or orange, to grab the viewer's attention. Additionally, you could use images or graphics that convey the idea of 'time running out,' such as a clock ticking or a person rushing to the hospital.
 
 **Task 3:**
 Your slogan, 'Beat the Clock, Beat Sepsis,' is catchy and effectively conveys the importance of seeking treatment quickly. However, consider adding a sense of urgency and importance to the slogan. For example, 'Every Minute Counts: Beat Sepsis' or 'Don't Wait, Act Fast: Beat Sepsis' would be more compelling and memorable.
 
 **Additional Suggestion:**
 Consider incorporating personal stories or testimonials from individuals who have experienced sepsis or have lost a loved one to the condition. This would add an emotional and relatable element to your campaign, making it more impactful and memorable for your target audience.",A,"The feedback form model A is best, but also provides partial solutions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Recognizing Your Biases
 In Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court held that segregation in public schools violated the Equal Protection Clause. Brown was a major blow to the separate but equal regime ratified by the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision in Plessy v. Ferguson. Brown is (rightfully) one of the most important constitutional cases ever decided, but it is still contested to this day whether Brown is consistent with the original understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment. Nonetheless, any legitimate theory of constitutional interpretation has to justify Brown, or it will not be taken seriously.
 This is true for many of the decisions that we often view as ""progressive"" or that significantly changed the way in which society operates. In the years after Brown, various minorities groups turned to
 the Court to effectuate broad changes in society. Civil rights, women‚Äôs rights, fairness in the
 criminal justice system ‚Äì the Warren Court, in particular, remade the landscape of America in a series of decisions in the 1950s and 1960s. As an African-American and a woman, I am especially proud of what they accomplished, but for constitutional law theorists, it is often difficult to justify many of these decisions as consistent with the ""original"" understanding of the Constitution or the Court's decision to intervene as consistent with the constitutional text and structure. Some scholars have been successful (in my view), but we still argue over these issues in the legal scholarship.
 Despite my pride in certain Warren Court decisions, I have to be honest and admit that when I teach cases like Plessy v. Ferguson or the Civil Rights Cases or Parents Involved or Washington v. Davis, I question whether it is wise to give courts the ability to ""remake"" the landscape of America. Talk about outcome oriented expedient, right? Not surprisingly, like most people (though they won‚Äôt admit it), I only like the Court to intervene when it furthers something I believe in. But I find this view to be problematic for a legal scholar, and as a result, I go to great lengths when I am writing to try to neutralize this bias.
 Indeed, my scholarship is my attempt to overcome this weakness and be as intellectual honest as I can. Sometimes, the result is that I make ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" arguments, but at the end of the day, it is my honest assessment of what I think the constitutional text and structure require rather than advocating for judicial intervention to achieve my desired outcome. Plessy and cases like it make me realize that the Court does not always get it right, and sometimes, because of the limitations of its power, cannot get it ‚Äúright‚Äù (see Giles v. Harris as a particularly egregious example). The problem for me and my particular bias is that, if one is intellectually honest, you have to take the good with the bad. Take the Plessy with the Brown, so to speak. This does not mean that I have to believe Plessy was decided correctly; rather, in advocating for judicial intervention, one has to recognize that sometimes you might get a Plessy. Other times, you might get a Brown but you have to believe that judicial intervention is justified in both instances (Lochner and Roe is another tough one).
 But the risk of a Plessy makes me wonder why we, as a society, are comfortable with the idea of the Supreme Court as being the change agent and in the process, promoting judicial intervention in lieu of the political process. I am always taken back by how pro-Court my students are. After teaching constitutional law for almost four years, it is not immediately obvious to me that this is right - that the Court, rather than the political process, should be the one to effectuate change. And that is why, in my scholarship, I focus on the constitutional text and the structure so I won‚Äôt have to decide if this is right (because I fear that my answer might be ‚Äúyes, it is right if I like the outcome‚Äù). I recognize that the text and structure will only get us so far in deciding tough questions, but I leave it to others braver than I to formulate theories of constitutional interpretation to fill in the gaps.

 Justice Souter in his Harvard speech had a realistic take of Plessy being a not overly egregious ruling in respect to the times. By now, we accept the courts to have a role in public policy matters up to a point, and it is a fact of life. It is best more of a ""nudge"" with certain moments when it is more. I respect your attempt at neutrality. As to Lochner, note even Justice Harlan -- who wrote or joined some ""Lochner-like"" opinions such as to yellow dog contracts -- dissented. There is a reason why it is seen as a symbolic bridge too far.

 Bias is various forms is with all of us. Bias is not evil most of the time. Hans Georg Gadamer's ""Truth and Method"" impressed me very much, especially with discussion of the Hermeneutical Circle that some, perhaps many, of us use in the process of decision making. The Hermeneutical approach to interpretation/construction of ancient texts can be applied to our not so ancient Constitution.
 I recently read and was impressed with Stephen M. Griffin's ""Book Review Colloquy: How Do We Redeem the Time?"" reviewing Jack Balkin's two recent (2011) books ""Constitutional Redemption: Political Faith In An Unjust World"" and ""Living Originalism."" It is available at SSRN:
 The Holy Grail of Constitutional Interpretation/Construction remains to be discovered, assuming it exists. In the meantime, I take comfort in the ""Horseshoes Theory"": close enough counts, as least for the time being. But the word ""Justice"" serves as conscience.
 Posted by: Shag from Brookline | Nov 9, 2012 7:35:02 AM
 Talking about bias, I just skimmed ""The Oath,"" the recent book on the Supreme Court and the chapter on Sotomayor's nomination comes to mind. In effect, it suggests Sotomayor's infamous ""wise Latina"" speech addressed the reality that everyone has some sort of ""bias"" though it not a comfortable thing to accept (the critics had their own biases all the same). Humans have biases, they are 'partial,' though they are cabined in various ways, including when interpreting law. It also helps to have multimember courts (or academies) where things hopefully balance out some.
 Posted by: Joe | Nov 9, 2012 9:55:28 AM
 I agree with you Franita. The problem is that the legislature has passed laws that are biased and invidiously discriminatory on their face.
 Would you support a Constitutional Amendment that strictly prohibited the mention of sex, age, race, national origin, marital status, breeding status, etc., in any law of the land?
 As it is, our laws are rife with sex preferences that generally favor women. With age preferences that deny the vote or choice of sex partner to minors. With marital- and family-status preferences that severely punish folks for being non-married or non-breeders. With funding rules for national parks and forests that Amerikans of color don't visit and for public schools that can't begin to educate them.
 If the country were run by Walmart, apart from equal access to great products, low prices and full employment, we'd have a place where gays and straights, marrieds and singles, Blacks and Whites, breeders and non-breeders, young and old, citizens and non-citizens, atheists and Romanists, would be treated equally once inside the door.

 What should we eat?
 Meals and snacks made from whole-food ingredients packed with energy and nutrition ‚Äî whenever we‚Äôre hungry.
 Doesn‚Äôt sound so confusing. Yet eating well and getting proper nutrition can seem exceedingly difficult ‚Äî so much so that obesity is an epidemic; American girls as young as 7 report being on diets; and weight loss is a multibillion-dollar industry. Why? The seemingly simple ways of eating well are obscured by a number of factors: Marketing, convenience, misinformation, stress and boredom, just to name a few.
 We eat for many reasons ‚Äî because we are truly hungry, yes, but also because someone cooked for us, or because it‚Äôs noon, or because we‚Äôre bored‚Ä¶or simply because food is there.
 It can also be hard to know which foods to eat. Sometimes our bodies crave foods we know aren‚Äôt good for us. Sometimes we don‚Äôt feel good, and we don‚Äôt know if food is the culprit. Sometimes we read conflicting information about what foods may or may not benefit us, or trigger inflammation, or lead to weight gain. And often, we eat foods that are not ultimately nourishing simply because they deliver fast energy.
 For all of these reasons and more, getting into a positive rhythm of eating can seem challenging. But honestly, getting there is the only hard part. When we tune in to our bodies and figure out the real food rules that work best for us as individuals, we look and feel our best. Then we can rely on our bodies to know instinctively what to eat, when, how, where and how much.
 Barring medical conditions that can‚Äôt be improved through diet, the food we eat is truly our greatest ally in achieving optimum health. According to Samantha Durland, a physician who specializes in women‚Äôs health in Lawrence, Kansas, ‚ÄúAt least 80 percent of how you look and feel comes directly from your diet.‚Äù
 Step 1: Get Educated
 Eating a well-rounded diet made up of a variety of whole foods and focused on eating lots of plants, plenty of high-quality protein, and satiating, healthy fats helps ensure we feel satisfied and energized all day. Many times food cravings indicate either we are dehydrated, in need of sleep or are eating for a non-hunger-related reason. Eat plenty of healthful foods, and we often find food cravings diminish or disappear.
 What to Eat: Respected food writer Michael Pollan said it best in his best-seller, Food Rules: ‚ÄúEat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.‚Äù ‚ÄúEat food‚Äù means real, whole foods made from real food ingredients. ‚ÄúNot too much‚Äù means eating when we are hungry and stopping when we no longer feel hungry (as opposed to when we feel full). And ‚Äúmostly plants‚Äù is self-explanatory. Although there are many valid styles of healthful eating, one thing all healthy diets have in common is plenty of leaves, roots, fruits, nuts, seeds, legumes and whole grains.
 When to Eat: Although advice on this topic abounds, the most recent research suggests that when we eat is far less important than what we eat. Experiment to see what eating schedule works best for you. Holistic nutritionist Stephanie Small emphasizes the importance of paying attention to your body. ‚ÄúThrough a period of trial and error ‚Äî trying out what‚Äôs been shown to work well, and then checking in with your body, energy level and even emotions to see if that works for you,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúyou can identify the eating schedule that suits your needs.‚Äù
 In the end, the schedule that makes you feel your best, provides sustained energy throughout the day and sets you up for a restful sleep is the right one for you. It will deliver the nutrients your brain and body need to perform their numerous functions, including detoxification, which is something our bodies usually know how to do all by themselves when we take care of ourselves well. The importance of keeping our bodies consistently nourished and blood sugar stable must not be underestimated. When we consume simple, processed carbohydrates, the glucose signals our bodies to release insulin to manage it. A fast drop in blood sugar follows that and leaves us hungry again. If we eat more processed carbs with lots of glucose, this roller coaster just keeps going. Eventually, our cells can become resistant to insulin, leading to myriad illnesses with severe consequences. Regularly eating plenty of protein, fiber and healthy fats; getting enough sleep; managing stress ‚Äî these healthy habits all contribute to stabilizing blood sugar.
 Curious About the Benefits of Fasting?
 Various types of fasting are practiced all over the world. Besides the cultural importance of certain fasts, modern science tells us that the practice does have practical benefits. Fasting can reduce inflammation, improve energy and boost metabolism. For many people, keeping blood sugar steady is too important to allow for intense periods of fasting, but we can still get some of these health benefits, physician and herbalist Aviva Romm says. Simply stop eating each evening in enough time to allow for at least 10 hours of fasting. For example, if you stop eating at 7:30 p.m., go to bed around 11, wake around 6:30 a.m. and then eat breakfast at 7:30, you will have fasted for 12 hours.
 If you have time to get a little bit of exercise before breakfast, so much the better, based on recent research published in the Journal of Physiology. The study compared three groups of men who ate a high-calorie, high-fat diet for six weeks and either exercised before breakfast, exercised after eating a carbohydrate-rich meal, or did not exercise at all. The only group that gained no weight and showed no signs of insulin resistance was the group that exercised in the fasted state. But don‚Äôt forget to enjoy a big glass of warm water before that run!
 Step 2: Get Ready
 Not being prepared to eat well is a quick way to sabotage our best intentions. When we‚Äôre running late and don‚Äôt have something nutritious ready to put on the table, it‚Äôs tempting to grab fast food or order a pizza.
 Prepare the kitchen: The easiest way not to eat junk food is not to have junk food on hand. Get rid of all the junk food in your house ‚Äî excessively processed foods, sugary foods, salty fried foods,
 foods made from refined white flour, and any foods you know you don‚Äôt tolerate well.
 Stock the pantry: Consider what you eat and when: Do you always want a snack in the late afternoon? Plan what you are going to eat and stock your pantry accordingly. When we buy apples and peanut butter, we eat apples and peanut butter. When we buy potato chips, we eat potato chips. Keep a healthy snack stash in the car, office and anywhere else you find yourself hungry without a good food option. Think of (or look online, in books or in magazines) fast, simple recipes with ingredients easy to stock for emergency dinner situations. It can also be useful to develop a system to keep track of what you have. Tools like the Evernote app (for iOs and Android) allow you to keep reminders about groceries that you can check when you‚Äôre at the market.
 Anna Thomas, author of the influential 1972 cookbook The Vegetarian Epicure and the more recent, award-winning Love Soup, says people have often asked her what they can do to improve their cooking. ‚ÄúImprove your shopping,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIf you start with something good, you will likely finish with something good, perhaps even great. But no amount of skill or fussing can overcome poor ingredients. Start with the best ingredients you can get, and treat them with respect. Your cooking will improve at once.‚Äù
 Develop systems: Grocery shopping routines help make eating well a habit that‚Äôs easy to maintain. Shopping on Saturdays, prepping food on Sundays and cooking quick, simple meals on weekdays works well for many people. Get in the habit of washing and chopping vegetables as soon as they come into the house so they‚Äôll be convenient to use when you need them. Make a big pot of quinoa or garbanzo beans that you can use in different ways throughout the week. Try recipes that make great leftovers for the freezer. Create a meal plan that is easy to follow. For example, roast a chicken or filet of salmon every week, sitting atop different seasonal vegetables, and flavor this one-pot meal with different herbs and spices each time. Make every Friday Mexican night. Or find one great seasonal cookbook, and cook through it for a whole week, month or season.
 Another strategy for simplification is sticking to one culinary tradition. Do as food writer Eugenia Bone does, and focus on cooking recipes of one cuisine, such as Italian or Greek, for a while. It‚Äôll be easy to stock your pantry appropriately, and you‚Äôll learn a tradition intimately. She can also help you strategically cook throughout the year through her Kitchen Ecosystem project (kitchenecosystem.com).
 The Restaurant Risk
 Reviews of studies conducted over several years confirm the relationship between eating at restaurants and weight gain, high body mass index, high bad cholesterol and low good cholesterol. According to physician, herbalist and midwife Aviva Romm, eating only one meal out each week translates to a two-pound weight gain every year. We simply don‚Äôt have enough control over what goes into our bodies when someone else prepares it. Of course, some restaurants are much better than others when it comes to using fresh, whole food ingredients. Eating highly processed foods made with inferior ingredients ‚Äî such as fast food or food from most chain restaurants ‚Äî is never good for our health. But even restaurants with healthier options generally include more processed ingredients, excess sodium, unhealthy fats and added sugars than we would ever use in home-cooked meals. When we‚Äôre working to establish good eating habits, it‚Äôs easiest if we eat most meals at home. Then when we‚Äôve achieved a healthy baseline, we‚Äôll be better prepared to choose wisely in restaurants ‚Äî and to know when to splurge.
 Step 3: Pay Attention
 As we endeavor to discover and establish our own best eating habits and routines, our first task is simply to pay attention to what we eat and how it makes us feel.
 Keep a food journal: This is the best way to pay more attention to what we eat and how it affects us. Don‚Äôt count calories or obsess over every detail ‚Äî you don‚Äôt even have to keep the journal for very long. But journaling is an excellent way to bring greater awareness to each food choice. Users often report its ability to positively affect food choices before eating. And many studies show that keeping a food diary is directly linked with successful weight loss. To try it, keep track of what you eat and when, and note how you respond ‚Äî mentally, physically and emotionally. Journaling can help clarify our eating patterns. Use a simple tally at the end of each day to note how many plants you ate: Was it the recommended seven to nine servings? Take note of how many sugary foods you ate: Did it add up to more than you thought? Did you feel energized afterward, or happy or guilty? Besides helping us figure out certain foods or patterns of eating that might not work well for us, journaling increases awareness of what and how much we consume.
 Eat mindfully: Awareness of what we eat leads directly into more mindful eating. A growing body of research links mindless, distracted eating with stress, anxiety and overeating. Practicing mindful eating, on the other hand, is about slowing down to become aware of all of our senses in the present moment in response to food, and tuning in nonjudgmentally to feelings of hunger, satiety and discomfort. It‚Äôs one of the most powerful ways we can learn how to nourish ourselves. We can start by taking a moment for gratitude before eating and asking ourselves simple questions whenever we eat something: Am I really hungry for this? How will this likely make me feel? Is there something I need more right now? (We‚Äôll cover mindful eating in more depth in our next issue.)
 Step 4: Reflect
 After we‚Äôve learned to pay more attention to our food choices, it often becomes clear what‚Äôs been working and what hasn‚Äôt. If you‚Äôve uncovered habits that are hindering your healthy eating goals, identify them and work to change them.
 According to Charles Duhigg, author of The Power of Habit, every habit consists of three parts: a cue, a routine and a reward. To create a new food habit, we must address all three components. Perhaps the cue to start eating fruit instead of sugar in the afternoon could be a phone alarm that reminds you every afternoon at 2 to get a piece of fruit. The routine is to eat the fruit. The reward could be as simple as adding a checkmark to a calendar or enjoying a small piece of dark chocolate afterward. Even if this seems counterintuitive, he says, our bodies eventually let go of the need for the chocolate and simply associate eating the fruit with the feeling of reward.
 Keep in mind that our taste buds may have become accustomed to sugary, salty, greasy and artificial flavors, and that we can change what our taste buds enjoy. For example, many people discover that, after reducing or eliminating refined sugar, they find sugary items to taste overly sweet. It also takes time to recalibrate if we are addicted to sugar and caffeine, but it is possible. Be patient with yourself. According to physician and herbalist Aviva Romm, thousands of her patients have reported that it took them about five to seven days for their taste buds to unlearn old habits. It doesn‚Äôt have to be all about restriction, either. Look for herbs, spices and other new, healthy ingredients to try for flavor and variety.
 If dietary changes produce unpleasant physical symptoms (fatigue, anxiety, irritability, constipation, sleeplessness, etc.), a dietary trigger could be to blame. Journaling and eating more mindfully can give us a hint of these triggers. But if that doesn‚Äôt prove to be enough, an elimination diet ‚Äî in which we systematically remove and then reintroduce certain foods ‚Äî may be helpful. Romm outlines a four-week program specifically tailored to women who feel chronically exhausted in her book, The Adrenal Thyroid Revolution. She helps readers create the diet most right for them by removing unhealthy or problematic foods, and then replacing them with foods and nutrients that activate the body‚Äôs ability to repair itself. ‚ÄúYour body is genius at moving you toward health; you just need help clearing out what‚Äôs getting in the way of what your body knows how to do,‚Äù she says.
 Step 5: Now, Eat for Pleasure
 We don‚Äôt have to journal, breathe and pause, reflect, eat all our meals at home and never have anything sweet for all time. Do not focus on calories. Do not focus on macronutrients. Focus on eating real, whole foods that come from nature, and on paying attention to how your own mind and body react to the foods you eat. Learning to eat well is about establishing a baseline that we can return to, setting us up for a lifetime of health and wellness. Once we‚Äôve given our bodies a chance to experience it, it‚Äôs not difficult to continue eating this way, which means we can focus strictly on enjoying food.

"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
 ‚ÄúCaleb‚Äôs Crossing‚Äù by Geraldine Brooks FIC BROO (also LARGE PRINT, PLAYAWAY)
 ‚ÄúCaleb‚Äôs Crossing‚Äù is based on the true story of the son of a Wampanoag chieftain in 1660s Massachusetts who became the first Native American to graduate from Harvard College. So if you like historical fiction, this would suit you well. The first-person narrator is Bethia Mayfield, daughter of a Calvinist minister. She and Caleb meet when they are 12 and become lifelong friends. Life is hard in Puritan New England, however, and the colonists are bringing rapid and extensive (often devastating) changes to the lives of the native population. Caleb is one of those curious and intelligent individuals who tries to act as a bridge between the two cultures to the benefit of both. Bethia is also quite curious and intelligent. Being a woman, though, she has to learn the hard way to keep silent most of the time.
 The dialogue between Caleb and Bethia is delightfully thought-provoking as they question each other‚Äôs way of life from farming and hunting to medicine and spirituality. And I do appreciate the various possibilities for the meaning of ‚Äúcrossing‚Äù in the title.
 Some critics have thought Bethia is too much of a feminist and too modern in tone, but the author stated in an interview that she can prove that women like Bethia did exist by citing the transcripts of court records. Most women did not learn to write and so there are few diaries or letters written by women from that period. Court transcripts were one of the few places where women actually had a written voice‚Äìand it was often a feisty one. Quiet women did not end up in court. Women accused of being witches and scolds did.
 It was a great pleasure to attend Geraldine Brooks‚Äôs presentation last fall as part of the QC Women‚Äôs Connection International Women Authors series. One of the things I remember particularly is her saying she doesn‚Äôt believe in writer‚Äôs block because though ‚Äúwriting may aspire to be art, it starts out as craft.‚Äù Other professions‚Äìshe suggested hairdressers or proctologists‚Äìdon‚Äôt have blocks. ‚ÄúWords are stones‚Äìthe book is the wall.‚Äù Every day before she begins writing, she takes a poetry anthology and lets it fall open. She reads that poem and that ‚Äúprimes her pump‚Äù.
 Other historical novels by Brooks you might like are ‚ÄúMarch‚Äù about the father of Louisa May Alcott‚Äôs ‚ÄúLittle Women‚Äù during the Civil War; ‚ÄúYear of Wonders‚Äù about a village in England which quarantines itself in the Plague year of 1666; or ‚ÄúPeople of the Book‚Äù about an ancient Jewish tome and all its owners through the years until modern times. For more suggestions, check our online database NoveList Plus or ask at the Information Desk for our staff-created bibliography ‚ÄúIf You Like Geraldine Brooks‚Äù. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Analyze the symbolism and significance of the title 'Caleb's Crossing' in the context of the novel.
 
 Discuss the various meanings of 'crossing' as they relate to Caleb's experiences and relationships throughout the novel.
 Examine the implications of Bethia's 'crossing' into the world of knowledge and ideas, despite societal expectations of her role as a woman in 17th-century Puritan society.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 The title 'Caleb's Crossing' is rich in symbolism, representing both literal and figurative crossings in the novel. On one hand, 'crossing' refers to Caleb's journey from his Wampanoag culture to the world of 17th-century Puritan society, where he becomes the first Native American to graduate from Harvard College. On the other hand, it signifies his bridging of the two cultures, as he navigates the complexities of colonialism and attempts to find common ground between his people and the English colonizers. Additionally, 'crossing' can be seen as a metaphor for Bethia's own journey, as she 'crosses' into the world of knowledge and ideas, defying societal expectations of her role as a woman in Puritan society.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: The analysis provides a good starting point for understanding the symbolism of the title 'Caleb's Crossing'. However, to strengthen the argument, consider incorporating more textual evidence to support the claims made about Caleb's and Bethia's journeys. Additionally, explore the implications of the title's multiple meanings and how they intersect and conflict with one another.
 
 To address the first error, consider adding specific quotes or scenes from the novel that illustrate Caleb's and Bethia's experiences with 'crossing'. This will help to build a more convincing case for the title's symbolism.
 To address the second error, consider delving deeper into the ways in which the title's multiple meanings intersect and conflict with one another. For example, how does Caleb's literal crossing of the cultural divide intersect with Bethia's figurative crossing into the world of knowledge? How do these different meanings of 'crossing' reinforce or challenge one another?","### FEEDBACK: 
 
 The analysis of the title 'Caleb's Crossing' is a good start, but there are a few areas that need improvement.
 
 * To strengthen your argument, consider providing more specific examples from the novel that illustrate the various meanings of 'crossing'. For instance, you could discuss how Caleb's education at Harvard represents a crossing from his traditional Wampanoag culture to the English colonizers' world.
 * When examining Bethia's 'crossing' into the world of knowledge and ideas, be more precise about how her experiences challenge societal expectations of women in Puritan society. You could discuss how her curiosity and desire for learning put her at odds with the patriarchal norms of her community.
 * Consider exploring the implications of the title 'Caleb's Crossing' in more depth. How does it relate to the novel's themes of cultural exchange, colonialism, and personal identity? What does the title reveal about the author's intentions and the novel's message?
 
 Some possible ways to revise your analysis include:
 
 * ""The title 'Caleb's Crossing' is a powerful symbol that represents the multiple journeys of the protagonist throughout the novel. Caleb's literal crossing from his Wampanoag culture to the English colonizers' world is mirrored in his figurative crossing into the world of education and knowledge. This is evident in his decision to attend Harvard College, where he becomes the first Native American to graduate. By exploring Caleb's experiences, we see how the title 'Caleb's Crossing' reflects the novel's themes of cultural exchange, identity, and the complexities of colonialism.""
 * ""Bethia's 'crossing' into the world of knowledge and ideas is a significant aspect of the novel, as she challenges societal expectations of women in Puritan society. Her curiosity and desire for learning put her at odds with the patriarchal norms of her community, where women were expected to be submissive and silent. By examining Bethia's experiences, we see how the title 'Caleb's Crossing' highlights the novel's themes of female empowerment and the importance of education in shaping personal identity.""",A,"Model A: Good structure, bad wording.

 Watching a toddler's bad habits can make any parent cringe, from the crunch as a child bites his nails to the aggravation of watching your daughter pick her nose. While some habits are completely harmless, others can increase your child's risk of getting an infection. Pick your battles, Mom and Dad -- scolding your child about all of his bad habits can be overwhelming. You might also want to take a look at yourself -- did Junior learn to pick his nose from Dad? Changing your bad habits can set a positive example for your tots.
 Pay attention to all of your tot's bad habits. As annoying or aggravating as these habits may be, children typically grow out of most bad habits within a few months. If habits persist, hold back on scolding your child for picking his nose, ears or scabs. Punishment is not an effective way of discouraging undesirable behavior.
 Offer alternative behaviors to your tot. If he is picking his nose, offer him a tissue or give him something else to do with his hands. Children often pick up bad habits through observation or as a way to relieve stress and boredom. Finding something to keep him occupied can help him learn a new method to cope with his feelings.
 Work on one bad habit at a time. Trying to change multiple bad habits at once can cause children to become anxious, fearful or overwhelmed. Pick one at a time and remain consistent -- every time you see the tot engaging in a bad habit, offer alternatives.
 Encourage your child when you see him engaging in alternatives to bad habits. If he is petting the cat instead of sucking on his fingers, say, ""It is so great that you are petting the cat!"" This can encourage him to continue positive habits without your guidance in the future. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Analyzing Habits in Children
 
 After reading the provided passage, design a hypothetical ""Habit Tracker"" mobile application for parents to monitor and modify their child's detrimental habits. Describe the core features of your application in 250 words or less, ensuring that every characteristic aligns with the guidance offered in the passage.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 The Habit Tracker app is designed to help parents monitor and change their child's detrimental habits. Core features include a habit catalog where parents can log and identify their child's habits, categorizing them as either positive or negative. The app includes a personalized habit plan, enabling parents to set goals and develop tailored strategies for eliminating negative habits. A reward system is also integrated, allowing parents to offer incentives when their child exhibits positive behavior. The app will also include a stress and boredom tracker to help identify triggers for undesirable habits. Additionally, a community forum will be included for parents to share and discuss their experiences with other parents. The Habit Tracker app will prioritize alternative behaviors, encouraging parents to offer engaging alternatives to bad habits. Real-time notifications remind parents to praise and acknowledge their child when they display alternative positive behaviors.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: 
 
 Your hypothetical ""Habit Tracker"" mobile application aligns well with the guidance offered in the passage. Here are some suggestions for improvement:
 
 * The habit catalog could be more specific by including a list of common detrimental habits in children, such as nail biting, nose picking, and thumb sucking. This will help parents quickly identify and log their child's habits.
 * The personalized habit plan could benefit from a step-by-step guide on how to develop and implement a strategy for eliminating negative habits. This could include tips on setting realistic goals and tracking progress.
 * The reward system is a great feature, but consider making it more customizable to accommodate different parenting styles and child personalities. This could include options for setting rewards for specific behaviors or milestones.
 * The community forum is a valuable resource for parents, but ensure that it is moderated to maintain a safe and supportive environment.
 * Consider adding a section for tracking progress and monitoring the effectiveness of the strategies implemented by parents. This could include a dashboard that displays the child's progress over time.
 
 Overall, your application has the potential to be a valuable tool for parents looking to modify their child's detrimental habits. With some additional features and refinements, it could become an even more effective and user-friendly resource.","### FEEDBACK: The Habit Tracker app is a good start, but it needs more refinement to effectively track and modify children's detrimental habits.
 
 The app's features are not clearly aligned with the guidance offered in the passage. For example, the passage emphasizes the importance of not scolding children for their bad habits, but the app's reward system may inadvertently encourage scolding when the child does not meet the expected positive behavior.
 The app's features are not well-integrated to provide a comprehensive solution. For instance, the stress and boredom tracker is a good idea, but it is not clear how it will be used to develop tailored strategies for eliminating negative habits.",B,Model B: This is great feedback!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 The idea that you can predict the climate based on it's temperature behaviour between 1970 and 1998 is silly. Just as the statement that the absence of warming since 1998 and 2011 cannot utterly disproove AGW the rise between 1970 and 1998 cannot 100% proove the theory that CO2 is a significant greenhouse gas at the levels we have today.
 Nobody is trying to predict temperatures based on historically temperatures over the last 40 or so. The predictions are based on our understanding of earth's climate over hundreds of millions of years and particularly the last 4 million years of recurring ice ages. The climate while complicated has to obey some very simple basic physical rules that is the energy coming in has over time to equal the energy going out. Change that simple relationship in some way and the temperature will change change until such time as the equation is back in balance. It is certain that greenhouse gases reduce the amount of energy that leaves the earth.
 Northern Europe is having a wet and cool summer, it's just America which is having a long, hot and dry one.
 No my original statement is correct
 According to NOAA:-http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/2012/6
 The Northern Hemisphere land and ocean average surface temperature for June 2012 was the all-time warmest June on record, at 1.30¬∞C (2.34¬∞F) above average.
 The Northern Hemisphere average land temperature, where the majority of Earth's land is located, was record warmest for June. This makes three months in a row ‚Äî April, May, and June ‚Äî in which record-high monthly land temperature records were set. Most areas experienced much higher-than-average monthly temperatures, including most of North America and Eurasia, and northern Africa. Only northern and western Europe, and the northwestern United States were notably cooler than average.

 When thinking about such climatic events it is vital to have a sense of proportion and not see a tiny change over 3 decades as a reason to think that there will be a drastic ""exponential"" continuation of this.
 The temperatures changes over the last 3 decades simply confirms our basic understanding of the climate.
 It is akin to having a graph of the speed of your car traveling along a highway. When the speed is 55mph your pasenger is happy, when the graph plots up to 57 mph the pasenger panics because the car is about to accelerate untill the machine disintergrates at the sound barrier. When the graph shows a slowing to 53mph the panic is of the sudden stopping of the car and the trafic behind slamming into the back of the car.
 No it is more being in a car where the cruise control is stuck and the speed just keeps increasing.
 Climate varies about quiote a lot.
 Because we live fairly short lives we do not rember the droughts of the dust bowl. We do not rember the medevil warm period. We do not rember the frost fairs on the frozen Thames.
 This is why we maintain weather data which shows that the current conditions are both worst and different.
 We should take these dire warnings with a big pinch of salt.
 Dire warnings should be assessed on the merits and action taken if necessary but never ignored
 The sea level rose by 18cm last centuary, how many cities flooded because of this? This centuary looks like it could be twice as bad, maybe.
 So as long as we split the sea level rises into 18 cm chunks it will be no problem ?

 Assessing Climate Change Predictions
 
 Using the analogies provided by Tim the Plumber (the car's speed graph and cruise control), think of another everyday scenario that can illustrate the relationship between human activities and climate change. Explain your chosen analogy in 100-150 words, and discuss how it can help or hinder our understanding of the issue.

 A suitable analogy for the relationship between human activities and climate change is the concept of overspending money. Imagine a checking account where income represents natural resources like forests and fossil fuels, while expenses represent human consumption and emissions. The account balance represents the state of the environment. Just as exceeding income with expenses leads to debt, exceeding the planet's capacity to absorb emissions leads to climate change. This analogy can help people understand the consequences of unsustainable resource use and encourage personal responsibility. However, it may hinder our understanding by oversimplifying the complexities of climate change and underestimating the scale of the problem.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: The analogy of overspending money is a good start, but it needs refinement to accurately represent the relationship between human activities and climate change. Consider revising the analogy to account for the non-linear effects of emissions on the environment, such as the tipping points and feedback loops that can lead to abrupt and irreversible changes. Additionally, think about how to incorporate the concept of planetary boundaries, which represent the safe operating space for human activities within the Earth's systems. By revising the analogy to include these complexities, you can create a more nuanced and accurate representation of the issue.
 
 The analogy could be improved by considering the concept of planetary boundaries and the non-linear effects of emissions on the environment.
 The analogy could be further developed by exploring the implications of exceeding planetary boundaries and the potential consequences for the environment and human societies.","### FEEDBACK: 
 
 Your analogy of the checking account is a great way to illustrate the relationship between human activities and climate change. It effectively conveys the idea that our consumption and emissions can have a negative impact on the environment. 
 
 One thing to consider is that the analogy could be more effective if it included the concept of interest rates. In the real world, interest rates can make it difficult to pay off debt, much like how the Earth's natural systems can be overwhelmed by the cumulative effects of human activities. This could add an extra layer of complexity to the analogy, making it more nuanced and accurate.
 
 Overall, your analogy is a good starting point, and with some refinement, it could be even more effective in helping people understand the issue of climate change.",A,"Model A is more actionable, but not very concise",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
 Nutrition and weight management before and during pregnancy has a profound effect on the development of infants. This is a rather critical time for healthy fetal development as infants rely heavily on maternal stores and nutrient for optimal growth and health outcome later in life. Prenatal nutrition addresses nutrient recommendations before and during pregnancy. Prenatal nutrition has a strong influence on birth weight and further development of the infant.
 A common saying that 'a woman is eating for two while pregnant' implies that a mother should consume twice as much during pregnancy. However, in reality this is not true. Although maternal consumption will directly affect both herself and the growing fetus, over eating excessively will compromise the baby's health as the infant will have to work extra hard to become healthy in the future. Compared with the infant, the mother possesses the least biological risk. Therefore, excessive calories, rather than going to the infant, often get stored as fat in the mother. On the other hand, insufficient consumption will result in lower birth weight.
 Maintaining a healthy weight during gestation lowers adverse risks on infants such as birth defects, as well as chronic conditions in adulthood such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Ideally, the rate of weight gain should be monitored during pregnancy to support the most ideal infant development.

 The ""Barker Hypothesis"", or Thrifty phenotype, states that conditions during pregnancy will have long term effects on adult health. Associated risk of lifelong diseases includes cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Babies born lighter in weight appear to have an increased rate of mortality than babies born at a heavier weight. This does not mean that heavy babies are less of a concern. Death rate would rise as birth weight increases beyond normal birth weight range. Therefore, it is important to maintain a healthy gestational weight gain throughout pregnancy for achieving the optimal infant birth weight.
 When this theory was first proposed, it was not well accepted and was met with much skepticism. The main criticism was that confounding variables such as environmental factors could attribute to many of the chronic diseases such that low birth weight alone should not be dictated as an independent risk factor. Subsequent research studies supporting the theory attempted to adjust these environmental factors and in turn, provided more convincing results with minimal confounding variables.
 ""Barker's Hypothesis"" is also known as ‚ÄúFetal Programming Hypothesis‚Äù. The word ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù illustrates the idea that during critical periods in early fetal development, there are persisting changes in the body structure and function that are caused by environmental stimuli. This relates to the concept of developmental plasticity where our genes can express different ranges of physiological or morphological states in response to the environmental conditions during fetal development.
 If the mother has an inadequate diet then it signals the baby that the living condition in the long term will be impoverished. Consequently the baby adapts by changing its body size and metabolism to prepare for harsh conditions of food shortages after birth. Physiological and metabolic processes in the body undergo long term changes as a result of restricted growth. When the living environment switches from the condition of malnutrition to a society of abundant supply of nutrients, this exposes the baby to a bountiful environment that goes against what its body is designed for and this places the baby at a higher risk of adult diseases later in adulthood. By the same token, if the fetus growing in the womb of a healthy mother is exposed to prolonged famine after birth, the infant would be less adaptive to the harsh environment than low birth weight babies.
 The Dutch Famine
 Since small birth weight is associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases in later life, and poor maternal nutrition during gestation contributes to restricted fetal development, maternal malnutrition may be a cause of increased disease susceptibility in adulthood.
 The Dutch famine of 1944 or the 'Hunger Winter' during World War II serves as an epidemiological study that is used to examine the effects of maternal under-nutrition during different gestational stages. The famine was a period (roughly five to six months) of extreme food shortage in the west of Netherlands. The famine was imposed on a previously well-nourished population and the official daily ration for the general adult population gradually decreased from 1800 calories in December 1943 to 1400 calories in October 1944 to below 1000 calories in the late November 1944. December 1944 to April 1945 was the peak of the famine where the official daily ration fell abruptly to about 400~800 calories. Even though pregnant and lactating women had extra food during the famine, these extra supplies could no longer be provided at the height of the famine. In the early May 1945, the liberation of the Netherlands restored the food supply. The daily ration had increased to more than 2000 calories in June 1945. What is unique about Dutch Famine as an experimental study on the effects of maternal malnutrition is that the population was strictly circumscribed in time and place and the sudden onset and relief of the famine was imposed on a previously well-nourished population.
 The Dutch Famine during World War II had a profound effect on the health condition of the general public, especially women who conceived during the period of time. The period of maternal starvation is shown to have limited intrauterine growth and has been identified as one of the most important contributor to coronary heart disease as well as other chronic diseases later in life. These findings agree well with Barker‚Äôs hypothesis; it supports the theory that maternal under-nutrition leads to a lower birth weight due to restricted intrauterine development and ultimately leads to higher risks of chronic conditions in adult life.
 Recommendations for Pregnant Women
 Gestation is the period of embryo development from conception to birth. Gestation is about 40 weeks in humans and is divided into three trimesters, each spanning 3 months. Gestational stages, on the other hand, are based on physiological fetal development, which include blastogenesis, embryonic stage and fetal stage.
 Blastogenesis is the stage from fertilization to about 2 weeks. The fertilized egg or the zygote becomes a blastocyst where the outer layer and the inner cell mass differentiate to form placenta and the fetus respectively. Implantation occurs at this stage where the blastocyst becomes buried in the endometrium.
 Embryonic stage is approximately from 2 weeks to 8 weeks. It is also in this stage where the blastocyst develops into an embryo, where all major features of human are present and operational by the end of this stage.
 Pre-pregnancy weight and gestational weight gain
 The pattern and amount of weight gain is closely associated with gestational stages. Additional energy is required during pregnancy due to the expansion of maternal tissues and stores in order to support fetal development.
 In the first trimester (blastogenesis and early embryonic stages), the mother experiences a minimal weight gain (approximately 0.5-2 kilograms), while the embryo weighs only 6 grams, which is approximately the weight 6 raisins.
 In the second trimester and third trimester (late embryonic and fetal stages), the fetus undergoes rapid weight growth and the weight increases to about 3000~4000 grams. It is also in this period that the mother experiences the bulk of her gestational weight gain but the amount of weight gain varies greatly. The amount of weight gain depends strongly on their pre-pregnant weight.
 Generally, a normal weight is strongly recommended for mothers when entering gestation, as it promotes overall health of infants. Maternal body weight is determined by the Body Mass Index (BMI) which is defined as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters. While pregnant, body weight should be managed within the recommended gestational weight gain range as it is shown to have a positive effect on pregnancy outcomes. Gestational weight gain should also be progressive and the recommended weight depends on pre-pregnant body weight.
 Since the total weight gain depends on pre-pregnant body weight, it is recommended that underweight women should undergo a larger weight gain for healthy pregnancy outcomes, and overweight or obese women should undergo a smaller weight gain.
 Normal Weight Women
 Women having a BMI of 18.5~24.9 are classified as having a normal or healthy body weight. This group have the lowest risk of adverse birth outcomes. Their babies are least likely to either be low-birth weight or high-birth weight. It is advised that women with a normal weight before pregnancy should gain a total of 11.5 kilograms to 16.0 kilograms throughout gestation, which is approximately 0.4 kilogram per week in the second and third trimesters.
 In order to maintain a steady weight gain, the mother should engage in mild physical activities. Participating in aerobic activities such as walking and swimming 3 to 4 times a week is usually adequate. Vigorous physical activity is not recommended since an excessive loss of calories is induced which is not sufficient to support fetal development.
 A proper diet is also essential to healthy weight gain. The common saying ‚Äúa woman is eating for two‚Äù often leads to mothers thinking that they should eat twice as much. In reality, only a small increase in caloric intake is needed to provide for the fetus; approximately 350 calories more in the second trimester and 450 calories more in the third trimester. Also, healthy choices should be emphasized for these extra calories such as whole grain products, fruits and vegetables as well as low-fat dairy alternatives.
 Women are classified as underweight if they have a pre-pregnant BMI of 18.5 or below. Low pre-pregnancy BMI increases the risk of low birth weight infants, but the risk can be balanced by an appropriate gestational weight gain from 12.5 to 18.0 kilograms in total, or about 0.5 kilogram each week in the second and third trimesters.
 Underweight women usually have inadequate nutrient stores that are not enough to provide for both herself and the fetus. While exercise and a proper diet are both needed to maintain the recommended weight gain, a balance between the two is very important. As such, underweight mothers should seek individualized advice tailored especially for themselves.
 Overweight and Obese Women
 Women with a high pre-pregnancy weight are classified as overweight or obese, defined as having a BMI of 25 or above. Women with BMI between 25 and 29.9 are in the overweight category and should gain between 7.0 and 11.5 kilograms in total, corresponding to approximately 0.28 kilogram each week during the second and third trimesters. Whereas women with BMI of 30 or above are in the obese category and should gain only between 5.0 and 9.0 kilograms overall, which equates to roughly 0.2 kilogram per week in the second and third trimesters.
 In general, walking is encouraged for mothers classified in this category. Unfortunately, estimated energy requirements for them are not available. As such, they are encouraged to record activity and intake level. This can be done with the help of tools such as My Food Guide Servings Tracker from Health Canada and EATracker that are available online. In extreme cases where the BMI exceeds 35, help from a registered dietitian is recommended.
 The following table summarizes the recommended rate of weight gain and total weight gain according to pre-pregnancy BMI for singleton pregnancies. The first column categorizes the type of body weight based on the Body Mass Index. The second column summarizes the total recommended weight gain for each type of body weight, and the third column presents the corresponding weekly weight gain during the period when the fetus undergoes rapid growth (during second and third trimesters). In extreme cases, the amount of total and weekly weight gain can vary by a factor of two depending on a woman's pre-pregnant weight. For example, a woman in the obese category is recommended to gain a total of 5~9 kilograms, whereas an underweight woman needs to gain up to 18 kilograms in weight.
 |Pre-pregnancy BMI Category||Recommendated Total Weight Gain||Weekly Weight Gain
 (after 12 weeks)
 |12.5~18 kg (28~40 lb)||0.5 kg (1.0 lb)|
 BMI 18.5~ 24.9
 |11.5~16 kg (25~35 lb)||0.4 kg (1.0 lb)|
 BMI 25.0~ 29.9
 |7.0~ 11.5 kg (15~25 lb)||0.3 kg (0.6 lb)|
 BMI > 30
 |5.0~9.0 kg (11~20 lb)||0.2 kg (0.5 lb)|
 Recommendations for Low and High Birth Weight
 In order to have a good estimate of birth weight, ultrasonography or ultrasound during pregnancy and the date of last menstrual period are needed. Measured values from ultrasonography are compared with the growth chart to estimate fetal weight.
 Crown rump length can be used as the best ultrasonographic measurement for correct diagnosis of gestational age during the first trimester. This correlation between crown rump length and gestational age would be most effectively shown when no growth defects are observed in first trimester. If growth defects were observed in the first trimester, then the measurement of the date of last menstrual period becomes quite important since the crown heel length has become less of a reliable indicator of gestational age.
 After the 20th week of pregnancy, the mother would need to visit the doctor for the measurement of fundal height, which is the length from the top portion of the uterus to the pubic bone. The length measured in centimeters should correspond to the number of weeks that the mother has been pregnant. If the measured number is higher or lower than 2 centimetres, further tests using ultrasound would be needed to check the results. Another way to estimate fetal size is to look at the mother‚Äôs weight gain. How much weight the mother gains can be used to indicate fetal size.
 Low Birth Weight
 There are two ways to determine small for gestational age infants. Many research studies agree that SGA babies are those with birth weight or crown heel length measured at two standard deviations or more below the mean of the infant‚Äôs gestational age, based on data consisting of a reference population. Other studies classify SGA babies as those with birth weight values below the 10th percentile of the growth chart for babies of the same gestational age. This indicates that these babies are weighing less than 90% of babies of the same gestational age.
 Many factors, including maternal, placental, and fetal factors, contribute to the cause of impaired fetal growth. There are a number of maternal factors, which include age, nutritional status, alcohol abuse, smoking, and medical conditions. Insufficient uteroplacental perfusion is an example of a placental factor. Chromosomal abnormalities and genetic diseases are examples of fetal factors. Identification of the causes of SGA for individual cases aids health professionals in finding ways to handle each unique case. Nutritional counseling, education, and consistent monitoring can be helpful to assist women bearing SGA infants.
 Complications for the infant include limitations in body growth since the number and size of cells in tissues is smaller. The infant likely did not receive enough oxygen during pregnancy so the oxygen level is low. It is also more difficult to maintain body temperature since there is less blood flow within the small body.
 As such, it is necessary to monitor oxygen level to make sure that it doesn‚Äôt go too low. If the baby can‚Äôt suck well, then it may be necessary for tube-feed. Since the baby cannot maintain body temperature sufficiently, a temperature-controlled bed would help to keep their bodies from losing heat. There are ways to help prevent SGA babies. Monitoring fetal growth can help identify the problem during pregnancy well before birth. It would be beneficial to seek professional help and counseling.
 High Birth Weight
 Research show that when birth weights of infants are greater than the 90th percentile of the growth chart for babies of the same gestational age, they are considered large for gestational age or LGA. This indicates that these babies are weighing more than 90% of babies of the same gestational age.
 Many factors account for LGA babies, including genetics and excessive nutrient supply. It seems that a common factor for LGA babies is whether or not the mother has diabetes when she is pregnant. An indicator for excessive growth, regardless of gestational age, is the appearance of macrosomia. Many complications are observed for LGA babies and their mothers. A longer delivery time may be expected since it is a difficult birth. The infant would likely suffer hypoglycemia (low glucose level in the blood) after birth. The infant would also have difficulty breathing.
 There might be a need for early delivery if the baby gets too big and perhaps Caesarean section would be needed. Since the baby is bigger in size, there‚Äôs a higher chance of injury when coming out of the mother‚Äôs body. To increase the blood glucose level in blood, a glucose/water solution can be offered to the infant.
 There are ways to help prevent LGA babies. It is necessary to monitor fetal growth and perform pregnancy examinations to determine health status and detect any possibility of unrecognized diabetes. For diabetic mothers, careful management of diabetes during pregnancy period would be helpful in terms of lowering some of the risks of LGA.
 Points to Consider
 The goal of pregnancy is to have a healthy baby. Maintaining healthy and steady weight gain during pregnancy promotes overall health and reduces the incidence of prenatal morbidity and mortality. This, in turn, has a positive effect on the baby‚Äôs health.
 Since conditions during pregnancy will have long term effects on adult health, ‚Äúmoderation‚Äù should be taken into account for both dietary and physical activity recommendations. Most importantly, the total recommended pregnancy weight gain depends on pre-pregnant body weight, and weight issues should be addressed before pregnancy.
 Future Direction for Research
 It is reasonable to expect higher weight gain for multiple gestations. Recommendations for women carrying twins are given but more research should be done to precisely determine the total weight gain, as these ranges are wide. Also, the ranges for underweight women carrying twins is unknown. There was not enough information to recommend weight gain cutoffs and guidelines for women carrying three or more babies, women of short stature (<157 centimetres), and pregnant teens. Estimated energy requirements (EER) for overweight/obese women are unavailable so more research is needed to evaluate on that.
 Practical Advice for Mothers
 The following general tips can be helpful to pregnant women. It would be beneficial to maintain adequate physical activity to meet energy needs from the food consumed. Eating a balanced diet would be optimal for healthy pregnancy results. To prevent problems like dehydration and constipation, it is important to drink enough fluids, especially water, to support blood volume increases during pregnancy. It is recommended to accompany regular meals with a daily prenatal vitamin supplement that has sufficient folic acid and iron content.
 If the fetus is predicted to have low birth weight, in addition to the general recommendations, it would be ideal to increase caloric intake, which can be done by having extra Food Guide Servings daily. If the fetus is predicted to have high birth weight, smaller and more frequent meals should be consumed to allow better weight management. Moderate sugar intake, such as fruit juices, is also suggested. It is essential to limit food and beverages with high calories and salt content.

 ### ANSWER:
 Maternal malnutrition during gestation contributes to restricted fetal growth, which in turn increases disease susceptibility in adulthood. According to the text, maternal under-nutrition during gestation limits intrauterine growth, leading to lower birth weights and increased risks of chronic conditions in adult life, such as cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. The Dutch Famine study serves as an epidemiological study that examines the effects of maternal under-nutrition during different gestational stages. For example, the study found that maternal malnutrition during the early stages of gestation has been identified as one of the most important contributor to coronary heart disease as well as other chronic diseases later in life. Additionally, the study found that restricted fetal growth due to maternal malnutrition is associated with changes in physiological and metabolic processes in the body that increase the risk of adult diseases. Importantly, this mechanism of restricted fetal growth and increased disease susceptibility in adulthood is strongly supported by the mechanism of mechanism of developmental plasticity where the fetus adapts to change the body structure and function in response to available nutrient supply for inhibited fetal development and prepare for harsh conditions of food shortages after birth.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK:

 Here's an example of how the response could be rewritten based on these suggestions:
 
 Maternal malnutrition during gestation has a profound impact on fetal growth and development, leading to increased disease susceptibility in adulthood. According to the Dutch Famine study, maternal under-nutrition during gestation limits intrauterine growth, resulting in lower birth weights and increased risks of chronic conditions in adult life, such as cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes, obesity, and hypertension (Roseboom et al., 2006). Furthermore, the study found that maternal malnutrition during the early stages of gestation has been identified as one of the most important contributor to coronary heart disease as well as other chronic diseases later in life (Roseboom et al., 2006).
 
 The mechanism of restricted fetal growth and increased disease susceptibility in adulthood is strongly supported by the mechanism of developmental plasticity, where the fetus adapts to change the body structure and function in response to available nutrient supply for inhibited fetal development and prepare for harsh conditions of food shortages after birth (Bateson, 2001). This adaptation can lead to long-term changes in physiological and metabolic processes in the body, increasing the risk of adult diseases.
 
 In conclusion, maternal malnutrition during gestation contributes to restricted fetal growth and increased disease susceptibility in adulthood. The Dutch Famine study provides strong evidence for this relationship, highlighting the importance of adequate nutrition during pregnancy for optimal fetal growth and development.","### FEEDBACK: Your response effectively explains how maternal malnutrition during gestation contributes to restricted fetal growth and increased disease susceptibility in adulthood, providing specific examples from the Dutch Famine study to support your argument.

 The Delicious Origins of 18 Summer Fruit Names
 Summertime means vacations, swimming pools, barbecues, and bushels of seasonal fruits. But just as juicy as summer‚Äôs many berries, stone fruits, and melons are the far-flung, surprising, and often obscure origins of their names.
 When the word first appeared in the 16th century, apricot looked like something only the Big Friendly Giant would eat: abrecock. English borrowed abrecock from the Portuguese or Spanish variant of the Arabic name for the fruit: al-barquq, ‚Äúthe apricot.‚Äù
 But apricot‚Äôs journey goes back farther than that. Arabic adapted al-barquq from the Greek praikokion, which itself took the word from Latin‚Äôs praecox. Literally meaning ‚Äúcooked before,‚Äù the ancient Romans thought the praecox was a variety of peach that ripened early. According to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), an earlier Latin name for the fruit was prunum or malum Armeniacum, the ‚ÄúArmenian apple,‚Äù from where it was historically cultivated.
 French formed the fruit‚Äôs name into abricot, which influenced the modern English spelling of apricot. The Latin word apricus, meaning ‚Äúsunny,‚Äù likely influenced the spelling too; the fruit was believed to ripen in such an environment.
 Some think the word peach is first attested in the English language all the way back in 1184 as the surname Pecche. This name is more likely from the French for ‚Äúsin.‚Äù Despite fruit having a long religious association with sin, peach probably first appears in 1400, when pechis, and later peche, was used to mean the ‚Äúpeach tree.‚Äù
 Via French, the English peche was grafted from the Latin persica, short for Persicum malum, or the ‚ÄúPersian apple.‚Äù
 Peachy was U.S. slang for ‚Äúgreat‚Äù‚Äîand of women, ‚Äúattractive‚Äù‚Äîby 1900. This usage probably stems from the fruit‚Äôs alluring shape or color, at least in the eyes of some beholders.
 A nectarine is a peach that lost its fuzz. Documented in various forms in the early 17th century, the name nectarine derives from a literary adjective, nectarine, ‚Äúsweet as nectar.‚Äù Via Latin, nectar derives from the Greek nektar, the drink of the Olympian gods. Some think nectar is a Greek compound of nek- (‚Äúdeath‚Äù) and tar- (‚Äúovercoming‚Äù), alluding to the drink‚Äôs mythical power to bestow immortality. So, you better stock up on nectarines this summer.
 A prune is a dried plum, but the word plum might just be dried prune. It‚Äôs a very old word in the language, found as plum in Old English. Scholars can trace it back to Middle Dutch and Middle Low German prume as well as the Old High German pfruma.
 The ultimate origins of these Germanic plums are disputed. Some think early Germanic speakers borrowed the Latin prunum, a ‚Äúplum,‚Äù possibly of a Near East origin. Prunum also gives English prune.
 Whatever their roots, plum and prune originally referred to the same thing: the plum. They diverged in the 1400s, thanks to the phrase dried prunes. They diverged again, thanks to metaphor. Prune became slang for a ‚Äúdisagreeable person,‚Äù later an ‚Äúold person.‚Äù Plum, meanwhile, became slang for something ‚Äúdesirable,‚Äù hence a plum job. Earlier, plum was a British colloquialism for 100,000 pounds, a nod to sweet sugar plums.
 What do cherries and peas have in common? Yes, they‚Äôre both small and round, but they are also both mistakes. Middle English mistook cherise, which came from France, as a plural word. It‚Äôs not, but speakers made cheri, later cherry, the word‚Äôs singular form anyway. English also did this to pea: The original, singular word was pease.
 The French cherise replaced the Old English ciris. Unlike peach, cherry does appear in an old surname: Chyrimuth, ‚Äúcherry mouth.‚Äù (Cherries have long been associated with lips.) Both cherise and ciris are ultimately picked from the Latin cerasum, ‚Äúcherry tree,‚Äù and the Greek kerasos before it. Kerasos might refer to a town in an ancient region of the Black Sea area of Turkey called Pontus; Romans believed one of their statesman, Lucullus, brought cherries back from there‚Äîbut it‚Äôs possible that the town itself was named after cherries.
 Technically, the strawberry isn‚Äôt a berry. So, does the fruit‚Äôs straw- actually have anything to do with straw? Etymologists simply don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs an unusual word, as the Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology explains: ‚ÄúNo corresponding compound is found in other Germanic languages and the reason for the name is uncertain.‚Äù Some suggest its ""seeds"" (called achenes, they‚Äôre the actual fruit of the strawberry) look like scattered straw, others that its slender stems (‚Äúrunners‚Äù) resemble straw stalks.
 Like the strawberry, the raspberry isn‚Äôt a true berry in the biological sense of the word. And also like the word strawberry, we don‚Äôt know what its rasp- is about.
 The word raspberry is found relatively late in English, attested in the early 1600s. An earlier form, raspis-berry, might give clues to its origins. In Middle English, raspise was a sweet, pink wine, possibly from the Anglo-Latin vinum raspeys. But this raspeys remains unexplained. Suggestions include the French rasper, ‚Äúto scrape,‚Äù referring to the fruit‚Äôs rough appearance, and an Old Walloon word for ‚Äúthicket.‚Äù
 The other sense of raspberry, the noise we make, say, when we blow on someone‚Äôs stomach, is short for raspberry tart, rhyming slang for ‚Äúfart.‚Äù
 8., 9., 10., 11., 12., AND 13. GOOSEBERRIES, ELDERBERRIES, MULBERRIES, LOGANBERRIES, BOYSENBERRIES, AND BLACKBERRIES
 Gooseberries might have nothing to do with geese and elderberries have no relation to older people: If the goose- is to do with the animal, no one has yet found a reason for this to be the case; while the elder- definitely has to do with the elder plant, but the name origin of that is tangled in the etymological bush. Mulberries are actually mulling over morons, well, the Greek moron, its name for the mulberry. This moron also appears in the second element of sycamore.
 But other berry-like fruits do have clear origins: loganberries and boysenberries are named for the scientists who developed them. And blackberries? Finally, summer fruit lobs us an easy one: It‚Äôs because they are black.
 Like blackberry, watermelon is another summer fruit whose name is straightforward, thanks to its light juice. But melon seems anything but a melon: Etymologically, it‚Äôs basically ‚Äúapple pumpkin.‚Äù
 Passing into English from French and Latin, melon ultimately comes from the Greek melopepon, joining melon (‚Äúapple‚Äù) and pepon (‚Äúgourd‚Äù). Pepon is a form of the Greek verb ‚Äúto cook‚Äù; as we saw with apricot, the notion is that melon was cooked, or ripened, by the sun. Pepon is also the source of the first part of pumpkin. The -kin is a diminutive suffix also seen in napkin, which we definitely need when we eat melons.
 Due to its sweet, ivory-green juice, this melon is likened to honeydew: a sugary, sticky liquid secreted by insects, often on plants. According to the folk etymology, people once believed this honey-like substance materialized from the air like dew. Honeydew melon is late to the English record; the OED first cites it in 1916.
 This melon also owes its origins to the Middle East. Legend says it was brought from Armenia to Cantalupo, a former papal estate outside of Rome where the fruit was grown. Legend has it that wolves once gathered and howled around this area, hence Cantalupo, the ‚Äúsinging wolf,‚Äù joining Latin words for ‚Äúsing‚Äù (cantare) and ‚Äúwolf‚Äù (lupus). But while most etymologists agree that it‚Äôs probably named after a place called Cantalupo, it‚Äôs very possible that the papal connection is a myth. No matter what, the English language didn‚Äôt start howling over its orange flesh until the mid 1700s.
 17. AND 18. LEMON AND LIME
 Finally, these seasonal citrus fruits go well together in poolside drinks, but their names originate in places we don‚Äôt always associate with water. They both were squeezed into English from French, then Spanish, then Arabic, and finally from the Persian limun, a collective word for ‚Äúcitrus.‚Äù Lemon, appearing around 1400, predates lime in the English record by over 200 years.
 A lemon is also a substandard car, usually passed off as in good condition. Describing something ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äúflawed‚Äù as a lemon dates back to the beginning of the 20th century. This usage might originate in American criminal slang of the early 1900s: The smarter con man could suck the juice out right out of a lemon, a ‚Äúsucker‚Äù or ‚Äúloser.‚Äù More likely, the slang is because the lemon leaves a sour taste‚Äîunlike so many of the delicious fruits in this article and their scrumptious etymologies. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Fruitful Explorations: Unraveling Etymological Connections
 
 Choose a summer fruit from the article and research its non-culinary historical references or associations. Create a visually appealing infographic that highlights these connections and explains their significance. Be sure to include the fruit's etymology as the central piece of information and explore at least two additional historical or cultural references related to the fruit. Your infographic should be concise, informative, and creatively designed.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 I choose the peach as the summer fruit for this assignment. The peach's etymology is rooted in the Latin word 'persica,' meaning 'Persian apple.' One historical reference to peaches is their association with immortality in ancient Chinese culture. In Chinese mythology, peaches were a symbol of eternal life and were often depicted in art as a fruit that granted longevity. Another cultural reference is the peach's connection to the color pink in Western societies. In the 17th century, the term 'peachy' emerged as a slang term for something that was excellent or of high quality, and later, in the 20th century, the term 'peach' was used to describe something or someone that was visually appealing, particularly in reference to skin tone.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK:

 Margarine: A Closer Look
 Margarine has its origins in France. In 1866 the French Government launched a competition that called for research into the development of a reasonably priced nutritive fat to be used as an alternative to butter.
 In 1869, a French chemist named Hippolyte M√®ge-Mouri√©s discovered the recipe for margarine using a mixture of beef tallow and skim milk. He won the competition prize and was granted a patent for his invention in France and England.
 In 1871, Mr. M√®ge-Mouri√©s sold his knowledge to the Dutch firm Jurgens, a company which eventually became the giant food corporation known as Unilever. Unilever was created in 1930 by the merger of British soapmaker Lever Brothers and Dutch producer Margarine Uni. The merger was logical for both companies, as palm oil was a major raw material for both products and could be imported more efficiently in larger quantities.
 The first margarine factory was built in Germany in 1872 and the first US factory was built between 1874 ‚Äì 1876.
 At first, the margarine was made from beef tallow and milk. But the price of tallow created a need for a cheaper fat source.
 In the 1890s, the meat packing monopoly controlled the price of lard and tallow needed to make candles and soap. Candle maker William Proctor and his brother-in-law, soap-maker James Gamble, combined their companies and took steps to gain control of the cottonseed oil business from farm to factory, with the aim of forcing tallow, (and the meat packers) out of the candle and soap business.
 By 1905, the two men owned several cottonseed mills in Mississippi. In 1909, P&G acquired the patent for the science of hydrogenation from Joseph Crossfield and Sons, a British company. By forcing the addition of hydrogen atoms to the fatty acid chain, this revolutionary industrial process transformed liquid cottonseed oil into a solid that resembled lard. This hydrogenation process was incorporated into the making of oil based spreads.
 Eventually, soybean oil became the main ingredient. By the mid 1930s, margarine was made with hydrogenated soybean oil, along with some added vitamin A and D. Consumption increased during the Depression years, and further increased significantly during World War II as butter was reserved for the soldiers fighting in Europe.
 The Nasty Process of Making Margarine
 Today, the production of margarine is a unappetizing process which uses several toxic chemicals. Here‚Äôs an overview of the steps involved:
 - Vegetable oil is made from oil seeds such as soybeans, corn, cottonseed or canola. The seeds are cleaned and crushed and the oil is extracted by applying high temperatures and pressure.
 - Since heat and light accelerate the rate of the reaction between polyunsaturated oils and oxygen, this extraction process causes the oils to become rancid, producing unpleasant and noxious odors and flavors.
 - Any oil left in the seed pulp is removed with noxious solvents such as hexane, an known neurotoxin.
 - The crude oil is then degummed with acid to remove other impurities, and a caustic soda is added to remove the degumming acids.
 - The resulting gray and smelly oil is bleached with Fuller‚Äôs earth (the same ingredient used in cat litter) and then filtered.
 - The rancid smells are removed through a high temperature steam cleaning deodorization process. This destroys any remaining nutrients and antioxidants.
 - The refined oil is mixed with a nickel catalyst and subjected to hydrogen gas in a high pressure, high temperature reactor. The high temperature and pressure in the presence of the nickel catalyst forces hydrogen atoms into the oil molecules, creating a partially solid, saturated product. This process is called hydrogenation. It is at this point that dangerous trans fats are created. Basically, the artificially created saturated fat molecules make their double bonds in the wrong places. These molecular misfits have been linked to inflammation, blood platelet stickiness, insulin resistance and other health problems.
 - The resulting gray, smelly grease is filtered to remove the leftover toxic nickel and other suspended materials.
 - The grease is then mixed with soap-like emulsifiers, then steam cleaned to remove the obnoxious odors.
 - The mixture is then bleached to remove the gray color, and artificial flavors, synthetic vitamins and natural colors (synthetic coloring is dangerous!) are added to improve the appearance and taste.
 - The mixture is now extruded into plastic tubs for sale.
 - Finally, clever advertising and marketing campaigns are implemented to promote the final product as a health food to the unsuspecting public, usually with the full endorsement of many scientists, doctors, nutritionists and health authorities.
 As you can see from the process above, oil based spreads are NOT health foods, and should be avoided. Instead, choose real, clean butter, preferably in raw or cultured form. In the butter vs margarine
 debate, butter is the clear winner.

 Questions like these teach us an important lesson: Images never speak the truth in and of themselves. Rather, the ensuing debates centred around the provenance of the evidence, the credibility of the source and, of course, the (hidden?) motives behind the editorial decisions.
 While the examples above are well-known, the everyday production and consumption of programmes, articles, music and images pose related questions all the time.
 Drawing the line between fact, opinion, entertainment and advertising is a difficult job, both for media users and providers. The skill used to do so is often referred to as media literacy: 'the ability to access, understand and create communications in a variety of contexts'.
 To illustrate why media literacy is never trivial, research suggests that the traditional journalistic trope of value; balanced reporting, may in fact be the very cause of bias.
 A scientific study found that ""denial discourse"" around climate change was granted far more media attention than merited in the scientific discourse, thereby delaying action for reasons of ""uncertainty"".
 In the face of 'information overload', there is a threat that people will choose to either switch off completely or only trust a very limited number of media sources. In turn, this has an impact on people's ability to participate fully in a democratic and plural society.
 The phenomenon is known as strategic ignorance. A survey by Gallup found, for example, that 41% of Americans, predominantly among those aged 30 and older, believe that the seriousness of global warming is exaggerated in the news; a record-high since surveys began in 1997.
 As we get information thrown at us and use a variety of media platforms to stay up-to-date, media literacy skills are absolutely fundamental to citizenship in modern society. This is about more than browsing the news; those in the know may enjoy more empowered lives, as they comfortably navigate the wealth of options on offer. From social networking, to getting directions, to understanding food labelling, to getting the best insurance deal, being media literate is as much about finding a 'voice' as it is about being a critical recipient.
 Indeed, as defined by Prof Sonia Livingstone, Head of the Media Department at the LSE, ""the promise of media literacy, surely, is that it can form part of a strategy to reposition the media user - from passive to active, from recipient to participant, from consumer to citizen.""
 A working group of media professionals under the Media CSR Forum found that there are three components to media literacy:
 Being able to access the media. Barriers to this could be technology or affordability related.
 Being able to understand and critically evaluate media. For example, the stages and filters information goes through to become content.
 Being able to create/interact with media.
 While access is becoming less of an issue, critically evaluating and creating media content remain high on the list of concerns. And since media literacy is not a fixed curriculum, they are bound to stay there as long as new formats and conventions continue to emerge.
 But how to enhance media literacy? Digital Britain, the Government's blueprint for a prosperous digital future, noted that ""no single organisation in isolation can effectively promote media literacy and there are many organisations that have a key role to play in the promotion of media literacy ‚Äì amongst both adults and children."" Undoubtedly, there is a lot to do, both on the 'supply' and the 'demand' side of media content.
 Today, the UK Media CSR Forum, a sector-collaboration between 20 of the biggest UK and European media companies, including the Guardian and Observer, is launching a joint website, signposting a range of innovative schemes to tackle media literacy. Examples include:
 Learnnewsdesk.co.uk. The Guardian's own online news portal where the content is specifically directed at 9-14 year olds and aligned with the school curriculum.
 Power to All People. Virgin Media's partnership with Digital Unite to provide greater access to the internet for the elderly among disadvantaged communities.
 Young Journalist. Sky's competition to encourage young people between the ages of 14-19 years old to report on local, national or international news stories that matter to them.
 With media literacy now gaining prominence outside the academic circuit, the industry reckons that a central resource for anyone with an interest in media literacy is long overdue.
 In addition to the case study section, the website also boasts the opportunity to create and share wacky headlines with friends or colleagues. Although light-hearted, it is nevertheless a useful way of demonstrating that nothing should ever be accepted at face value.
 The website can be reached through howmediaismade.com or elviswalks.com. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Have researchers proven that citizens who actively analyse the media are better equipped to participate in democratic societies?
 
 Create a two-paragraph essay response. Address one study mentioned in the provided text that supports citizens' active analyse of media and how it adds to their ability to engage in democratic societies. In the second paragraph, define media literacy and its three components, discussing the importance of promoting these skills in both adults and children. Limit your response to 200-250 words.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 The text suggests that yes, researchers have proven that citizens who actively analyse the media are better equipped to participate in democratic societies. A study on 'denial discourse' around climate change provides a good example of this. It found that when media reporting is biased, it can delay action by creating 'uncertainty'. Therefore, it is essential for citizens to critically evaluate information and avoid misinformation that can hinder their participation in democratic and plural societies. By doing so, they will be empowered to make informed decisions and engage in discussions about global issues such as climate change. By enhancing citizens' media analysis skills, they can mitigate the impact of biased reporting and develop the critical thinking necessary to participate in a democratic society. Media literacy is the skill needed to access, understand, and create communications in a variety of contexts. It has three main components, including access to the media, understanding, and critical evaluation of media content, and the ability to create or interact with media. Promoting media literacy skills in both adults and children is crucial, as it enables citizens to navigate the wealth of options available and make informed decisions.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: 
 
 The essay effectively addresses the question and provides a clear example of a study that supports the idea that citizens who actively analyse the media are better equipped to participate in democratic societies. The discussion on 'denial discourse' around climate change is well-explained and highlights the importance of critical thinking in avoiding misinformation. However, the essay could benefit from more detail on how the study's findings relate to the broader context of media literacy and democratic participation.
 
 To improve, consider expanding on the significance of the study's results and how they contribute to the overall argument. Additionally, the second paragraph could be more cohesive and clearly linked to the first paragraph. The definition of media literacy and its components is clear, but the discussion on promoting these skills could be more nuanced, exploring the challenges and opportunities in doing so.
 
 Some suggestions for improvement include:
 
 * Providing more context on the study's methodology and findings
 * Exploring the implications of the study's results for media literacy and democratic participation
 * Discussing the challenges and opportunities in promoting media literacy skills in both adults and children
 * Using more specific examples to illustrate the importance of media literacy in everyday life","### FEEDBACK: The response provides a good overview of the topic, but there are a few areas that need improvement.

 - ""Arriving at the prison now.""
 Prisons were installations primarily used for incarcerating individuals.
 Types of prisons
 Different prisons used various methods to contain individuals, either through locking them in a physical cage, or with the use of simple force field barriers or containment fields, such as those used by the Geonosians. Some containment devices, such as Force cages, could also be modified to project electrical currents through the captured individuals as a form of torture.
 The Rakata were known to utilize an incarceration method called the mind prison, where the prisoner's mind would be stripped from his or her body and be locked away within the prison, presumably forever. According to one prisoner, the only means of escape was by transferring the imprisoned mind into the body of another who had inadvertently become trapped, although this required the consent of both involved.
 Entire planets were occasionally used as prisons. Planets such as Mytus VII, also known as Stars' End, was known as one of the most dreaded prison planets in the galaxy. Despayre was another prison planet used by the Galactic Empire, but was destroyed by the Death Star's superlaser as part of a test of its firepower.
 Also the Jedi Order kept a secret prison to hold dangerous sometimes Force-sensitive beings.
 Belsavis was one of the oldest prisons in existence, a super-prison constructed by the Infinite Empire. It contained extremely ferocious prisoners, and was adapted for use by the Galactic Republic during the Great Galactic War. Unfortunately for the Republic, in the early years of the Cold War, the Sith Empire's Imperial Intelligence discovered its location and sent agents into the prison to liberate important Imperial prisoners, causing the planet to become a battleground.
 Desolation Alley was a notable prison on Oovo IV, which held a number of prisoners such as Meeko Ghintee and Bendix Fust. It was also used for podracing, which was virtually the only form of entertainment available to the prisoners. Jango Fett and Zam Wesell both attempted to recover Fust from the heavily guarded prison. It was during this successful escape attempt that Jango Fett procured the Firespray-class patrol ship that he later named the Slave I, after the loss of his original ship in the skirmish.
 Possibly the most notable, however, is the prison camp on Kessel which was home to the galaxy's largest spice mining operation. Under Imperial rule, slave labor was extensively used in the mines. Kessel would hold many Rebels prisoners of war during the Galactic Civil War such as Wedge Antilles, who would be rescued by Rogue Squadron. The crime lord Tyber Zann was also incarcerated at Kessel for stealing a Sith holocron from the Empire and the Hutt Cartel. He would later escape thanks to Urai Fen creating a prison riot diversion.

 The Kessel prison is the most notable example of how technological advancements, galactic politics, and societal influences have shaped the development and use of a prison in the Star Wars Universe.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: 
 The Kessel prison is a prime example of how technological advancements, galactic politics, and societal influences have shaped the development and use of a prison in the Star Wars Universe. The prison's use of slave labor, extensive mining operations, and harsh conditions demonstrate the impact of technological advancements on the treatment of prisoners. The fact that the prison was used by the Empire to house Rebel prisoners of war, such as Wedge Antilles, highlights the role of galactic politics in shaping the prison's purpose and population. Furthermore, the prison's connection to the spice mining industry and the crime lord Tyber Zann's escape attempt illustrate the societal influences that have shaped the prison's structure and operations.
 
 The answer could be strengthened by providing more specific examples of how technological advancements, galactic politics, and societal influences have shaped the Kessel prison. For instance, the answer could discuss how the Empire's use of slave labor and the prison's connection to the spice mining industry reflect the societal influences at play.
 The answer could benefit from a clearer structure and organization. Consider breaking the answer into clear paragraphs or sections to improve its readability and clarity.","### FEEDBACK: 
 
 Your analysis of the various prison types in the Star Wars universe is a good start. However, to make it more comprehensive, consider the following:
 
 * When discussing the Rakatan Mind prison, you could explain how it differs from other prisons in terms of its use of mental manipulation and the implications of such a method on the prisoners.
 * When discussing the Jedi secret prison, you could explain how it fits into the Jedi Order's values and how it is used to maintain balance in the Force.
 * When discussing the whole planet used as a prison like M'Bardi, you could explain how the use of an entire planet as a prison affects the prisoners, the environment, and the surrounding space.
 
 In terms of your chosen prison, Kessel, consider the following:
 
 * You could elaborate on how the Imperial rule and the use of slave labor in the spice mines have shaped the prison's structure and the treatment of its prisoners.
 * You could also discuss how the Rebel Alliance's efforts to rescue prisoners like Wedge Antilles have impacted the prison's role in the larger Star Wars universe.
 
 Here's an example of how you could expand on your analysis:
 
 ""The Kessel prison is a prime example of how technological advancements, galactic politics, and societal influences have shaped the development and use of a prison in the Star Wars universe. The use of slave labor in the spice mines, facilitated by the Imperial rule, has created a unique structure and treatment of prisoners. The Rebel Alliance's efforts to rescue prisoners like Wedge Antilles have also impacted the prison's role in the larger Star Wars universe.
 
 In contrast, the Rakatan Mind prison uses mental manipulation, which raises questions about the implications of such a method on the prisoners. The Jedi secret prison, on the other hand, is used to maintain balance in the Force, highlighting the importance of the Jedi Order's values.
 
 A whole planet used as a prison like M'Bardi, affects the prisoners, the environment, and the surrounding space in a way that is different from other prisons. The use of an entire planet as a prison has significant consequences for the prisoners and the environment, making it a unique aspect of the Star Wars universe.""

 Refugee Nutrition Information System
 Every year, thousands of individuals are displaced from their homes and homelands because of wars, political conflicts, and natural disasters. The Refugee Nutrition Information System (RNIS) was established in 1993 to collect data and report on the nutrition, health, and survival status of the most nutritionally vulnerable people in the world, including refugees, internally displaced populations, and those who are forced to migrate.
 These girls are among more than four million Palestinian refugees in Gaza Strip and the West Bank. A recent report from the Refugee Nutrition Information System found Palestinian refugees to be satisfactorily coping with the nutritional impacts of the latest Intifada.
 These refugees were displaced by years of warfare in their own countries. In the 1980s they came to Sudan from Ethiopia and Chad, only to find a famine awaiting them.
 The RNIS publication, Report on the Nutrition Situation of Refugees and Displaced Populations, is published every three months, with interim updates as needed. The United Nations (UN) Administration Committee on Coordination Sub Committee on Nutrition (ACC/SCN) compiles this report. Information is obtained from a variety of UN agencies and nongovernmental organizations.
 The report focuses primarily on sub-Saharan Africa, with some information provided on Asia. The report gives an estimate of the total number of refugees and displaced persons, and of the returning population, broken down by risk category. Refugees and displaced populations are classified by country of origin and country of asylum. The report also shows trends over time in total numbers and risk categories.
 The report is organized by ""situation,"" a category that crosses national boundaries, and it includes a section that highlights the most pressing humanitarian needs. Recommendations are made by agencies or individuals directly involved in assessments or humanitarian response. Nutritional surveys are used to assess populations that are in a critical situation. Populations at high risk are identified either on the basis of indicators that are approaching crisis levels or through subjective information collected when security and logistical issues prevent rigorous data collection.

 EPFL and Technion researchers have figured out the ‚Äúchampion‚Äù nanostructures able to produce hydrogen in the most environmentally friendly and cheap manner, by simply using daylight.
 In the quest for the production of renewable and clean energy, photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) constitute a sort of a Holy Grail. PECs are devices able of splitting water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen in a single operation, thanks to solar radiation. ‚ÄúAs a matter of fact, we‚Äôve already discovered this precious chalice, says Michael Gr√§tzel, Director of the Laboratory of Photonics and Interfaces (LPI) at EPFL and inventor of dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells. Today we have just reached an important milestone on the path that will lead us forward to profitable industrial applications.‚Äù
 This week, Nature Materials is indeed publishing a groundbreaking article on the subject. EPFL researchers, working with Avner Rotschild from Technion (Israel), have managed to accurately characterize the iron oxide nanostructures to be used in order to produce hydrogen at the lowest possible cost. ‚ÄúThe whole point of our approach is to use an exceptionally abundant, stable and cheap material: rust,‚Äù adds Scott C. Warren, first author of the article.
 At the end of last year, Kevin Sivula, one of the collaborators at the LPI laboratory, presented a prototype electrode based on the same principle. Its efficiency was such that gas bubbles emerged as soon as it was under a light stimulus. Without a doubt, the potential of such cheap electrodes was demonstrated, even if there was still room for improvement.
 By using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques, researchers were able to precisely characterize the movement of the electrons through the cauliflower-looking nanostructures forming the iron oxide particles, laid on electrodes during the manufacturing process. ‚ÄúThese measures have helped us understand the reason why we get performance differences depending on the electrodes manufacturing process‚Äù, says Gr√§tzel.

 Using the information about the EPFL and Technion research on photoelectrochemical cells (PECs), think creatively about the potential impact of this technology on your daily life. 
 
 Describe one way you think PECs could be used in your home or community to produce clean energy.
 Explain how the use of iron oxide (rust) as a material in PECs could affect the cost of this technology.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 1. PECs could be used in my home to create a self-sustaining backyard pond that produces oxygen and hydrogen from sunlight, providing a constant source of clean energy while also creating a thriving ecosystem. 2. The use of iron oxide as a material in PECs could significantly reduce the production cost, making this technology more acessable, and positioning this tech better than the current market standards.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: 
 
 Overall, your response demonstrates a good understanding of the PECs technology and its potential applications. Here's how you can improve:
 
 1. To further enhance your answer, consider providing more details about how the self-sustaining backyard pond would work. For example, you could explain how the PECs would be integrated into the pond's design or how the hydrogen and oxygen produced would be utilized.
 
 2. When discussing the cost-effectiveness of using iron oxide, you could provide more specific examples or data to support your claim. This would make your argument more convincing and help readers understand the potential economic benefits of this technology.
 
 3. Finally, consider using more precise language when explaining the impact of PECs on your daily life. For instance, instead of saying ""self-sustaining backyard pond,"" you could describe a ""solar-powered water feature"" or a ""hydrogen-producing aquatic ecosystem.""
 
 ### FEEDBACK FOR EACH MISTAKE:
 
 1. **Lack of detail:** ""To further enhance your answer, consider providing more details about how the self-sustaining backyard pond would work."" 
 
  * You could explain how the PECs would be integrated into the pond's design or how the hydrogen and oxygen produced would be utilized.

 Oracle With Clause :
 In my previous article i have given the different SQL tutorials with real life examples.In this article i will give you the Oracle With Clause information with its examples. You might have seen that so many reporting tool queries starts with Oracle With Clause.The With Clause is mainly used to improve the performance of the specific query.The Oracle 9i provides the new functionality of With Clause.The with clause is just like temporary tables in oracle.Mainly the with clause is used to execute subqueries in fast way.It is called as sub-query factoring.
 Oracle With Clause Syntax and Examples :
 In this section i would like to explain the syntax as well as examples of With clause in oracle.Before checking the syntax and examples of With clause in oracle let us first check some important bullet points of With Clause :
 - With Clause in Oracle is released in Oracle 9i release 2 to improve the performance of complex sql queries.
 - The clause works like a global temporary tables of oracle which is used to improve the query speed of complex sql queries.
 - This technique is also called as sub-query factoring as it is used to De-factor the subqueries.
 - With clause in oracle is not supported by all oracle versions ,the oracle version 9i and beyond versions.
 - When sub-query needs to be executed multiple times at that time With clause is used.
 - The name which is assigned to the sub-query is treated as though it was an inline view or table.
 - The With Clause is useful in Recursive queries as well.
 These are some important points of With Clause in oracle. In following section i would like to explain about the syntax as well as multiple examples of with clause.
 With SQL_Query_Name As
 Select * from New_SQL_Query_name;
 Execution of With Clause :
 In this section i would like to explain about the step by step execution of With clause.
 Step 1 : The SQL Query within the with clause is executed at first step.
 Step 2 : The output of the SQL query is stored in to temporary relation of with clause.
 Step 3 : The Main query is executed with temporary relation produced at last stage.
 With Clause with Aggregation :
 In this section i would like to give you example with its syntax for With clause with aggregation.There are so many times the With clause is used in oracle .
 (The aggregation SQL statement)
 (query name sub-query_name);
 Real life example 1 :
 Let us take the example of Student table.If user wants to find out the Students from Student table whose marks is more than Average of all marks.
 (Select Avg(Marks) From Student),
 Select Roll_No,Name,Marks From Student , Student_Temp
 Where Student.Marks > Student_Temp.Average_Marks);
 The above example will give you the Students whose marks are greater than average marks with using With Clause with Aggregation.
 Real Life Example 2 :
 There are some situations where user needs to calculate Salary of the Employee with Total number of the Employees and user needs to show it department-wise then following query is useful.
 With Department_Count As
 Select Dept_No,Count(Emp_No) As ‚ÄòNo_Of_Employees‚Äô
 Group by Dept_No
 From Employee E,
 Where E.Dept_no = C.Dept_No;
 Points to Remember :
 In this section, I would like to give some important points to remember while using With Clause in Oracle.
 Point 1 :
 The With clause in Oracle can be beneficial for complex SQL queries. For Simple SQL queries dont use with clause to make it complicated.
 Point 2 :
 The with clause fragments the complex subqueries in to queries.It is used for simple debugging of the query.
 Point 3 :
 The With clause in oracle is nothing but the drop -in replacement for normal subqueries.
 Point 4 :
 When User find the sub-query and needs to improve the performance ; Try to use With clause and convert that sub-query in to With clause query to improve the performance.
 These are above some most important points to remember while using With clause in Oracle. I hope this article will be useful for users. If you like this article or if you have any concerns with the same kindly comment in to comments section. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 SQL Query Optimization Using Oracle With Clause
 
 Create a real-life SQL query scenario where using an Oracle With Clause can significantly improve query performance, and include an explanation of the benefits of using the With Clause in this specific scenario.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 Consider a real-life scenario where we have a large table called ‚ÄòOrders‚Äô with millions of rows, and we need to calculate the total value of orders for each customer, as well as the percentage of the total value contributed by each customer. Without using the With Clause, the query would look like this: SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_value) as total_value, (SUM(order_value) / (SELECT SUM(order_value) FROM Orders)) * 100 as percentage FROM Orders GROUP BY customer_id; However, this query is inefficient because it needs to calculate the total sum of order values for each row. By using the With Clause, we can precalculate the total sum and improve performance: WITH total_orders AS ( SELECT SUM(order_value) as total FROM Orders ) SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_value) as total_value, (SUM(order_value) / (SELECT total FROM total_orders)) * 100 as percentage FROM Orders GROUP BY customer_id; The benefits of using the With Clause here are that it avoids the correlated subquery and calculates the total sum only once, reducing the computational overhead and improving query performance.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: SQL Query Optimization Using Oracle With Clause
 
 **Excellent effort!** Your assignment demonstrates a clear understanding of the Oracle With Clause and its application in optimizing SQL queries.
 
 **Strengths:**
 
 1. **Real-life scenario**: Your scenario is well-explained and relevant to a real-world problem, making it easier to understand the benefits of using the With Clause.
 2. **Query optimization**: You effectively demonstrate how the With Clause improves query performance by avoiding correlated subqueries and calculating the total sum only once.
 3. **Clear explanation**: Your explanation of the benefits of using the With Clause is concise and easy to follow.
 
 **Suggestions for improvement:**
 
 1. **Use proper SQL syntax**: In the first query, you're missing a closing parenthesis after the `FROM Orders` clause.
 2. **Provide more context**: While your scenario is clear, providing more context about the table structure, data volume, and query performance issues would make your explanation more comprehensive.
 3. **Use more descriptive variable names**: Variable names like `total_orders` and `total` are not very descriptive. Consider using more descriptive names to improve code readability.
 
 **Additional feedback:**
 
 * Your assignment is well-structured and easy to follow.
 * You've provided a clear and concise explanation of the benefits of using the With Clause.
 * Your query optimization example is well-explained and relevant to a real-world problem.
 
 Overall, your assignment demonstrates a good understanding of the Oracle With Clause and its application in optimizing SQL queries. With a few minor adjustments, your assignment will be even more effective in conveying your knowledge and ideas. Keep up the good work!","### FEEDBACK: Your explanation of the benefits of using the With Clause in the scenario is clear and concise. However, there are a couple of areas for improvement.
 
 You mentioned that the With Clause avoids the correlated subquery, but it's more accurate to say that it avoids the correlated subquery in the original query. The With Clause itself does not contain a correlated subquery.
 You correctly identified the benefits of using the With Clause, but you could have also mentioned that the With Clause allows for easier maintenance and modification of the query, as the precalculated total sum is defined in a separate section.",B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 The series of posts on the National Debt keeps growing. I spent months researching the topic in an attempt to understand its history and evolution.
 My first draft of this series of seven posts was at least three-times longer than the final copy. It is confusing enough, so I cut.
 However, this morning I awoke wanting to know how much of the national debt each president and his congress was responsible for.
 The reason I do not blame just the presidents is because each president submits the annual budget to Congress and Congress may add to or subtract from what the president requests. Then Congress must vote to enact the budget and the president signs it into law. Then there is the mandatory part of the budget and the discretionary portion. The president and Congress, without cooperation, cannot do much about the mandatory section of the budget such as Social Security.
 For the sake of simplicity, I did not attempt to do the math to discover the exact amount each president (except G.W. Bush and Obama) is responsible for beyond his term in office, because if President Truman is responsible for $8.6 Billion of today‚Äôs $16.3509 Trillion national debt, then he is also responsible for the annual interest on that $8.6 Billion and the interest compounded annually on that interest for sixty years. If someone wants to figure that out, be my guest. But first, you would have to know what the interest rate was for each year of those sixty years after Truman left office and the interest seems to change every three months.
 For example, I found a post at Intellectual Take Out.org on the interest rates of the national debt starting in 1970 (you may notice that the interest rate has been as high as 14% and as low as 0.1%. At the end of 2010, the interest was 1.7%).
 Each President‚Äôs (and his Congress) share of the National Debt
 - Truman‚Äôs share of the National Debt was $8.6 Billion.
 - Eisenhower‚Äôs share was $5.6 Billion.
 - Kennedys share was $3.3 Billion.
 - LBJ‚Äôs share was $9.3 Billion.
 - Nixon‚Äôs share was $54.6 Billion.
 - Ford‚Äôs share was $48.4 Billion.
 - Carter‚Äôs share was $168.8 Billion.
 - Reagan‚Äôs share was $2.2376 Trillion.
 - G. H. W. Bush‚Äôs share was $1.143 Trillion.
 - Clinton‚Äôs share was $74 Billion.
 - G. W. Bush‚Äôs share was $6.3002 Trillion.
 - Obama‚Äôs share is currently about $2 Trillion.
 THE DETAILS OF THE RESEARCH:
 When Harry Truman became president (1945 ‚Äì 1952), the National Debt from World War II was $260.1 Billion. The Interest on the debt during Truman‚Äôs term as president was $32.6 Billion. Truman was responsible for about $8.6 Billion of that interest.
 The National debt Eisenhower (1953 ‚Äì 1960) inherited from President Truman in 1953 was $266 Billion‚Äîan increase of $5.9 Billion. During Eisenhower‚Äôs term as president the interest on the debt was $44.8 Billion. Eisenhower was responsible for about $5.6 Billion.
 The debt Kennedy (1961 ‚Äì 1963) inherited from Eisenhower in 1961 was $292.6 Billion‚Äîan increase of $26.6 Billion. The interest on the debt during Kennedy‚Äôs years as president was $14.4 Billion.
 The debt LBJ (1963 ‚Äì 1968) inherited from Kennedy after his assassination in 1963 was $310.3 Billion‚Äîan increase of $17.7 Billion. The interest on the debt during LBJ‚Äôs years as president was $55.3 Billion. LBJ was responsible for about $9.1 Billion.
 The debt Nixon (1969 ‚Äì 1973) inherited from LBJ in 1969 was $365.8 Billion‚Äîan increase of $55.5 Billion. The interest during his term was $74.7 Billion. Nixon is responsible for about $11.2 Billion.
 The debt Ford (1974 ‚Äì 1976) inherited from Nixon in 1971 was $483.9 Billion‚Äîan increase of $118.1 Billion. The interest during his term was $70.9 Billion. Ford is responsible for $6.7 Billion.
 The debt Carter (1977 ‚Äì 1980) inherited from Ford in 1977 was $706.4 Billion‚Äîan increase of $222.5 Billion. The interest during his term was $160.5 Billion. Carter is responsible for about $40.9 Billion.
 The debt Reagan (1981 ‚Äì 1988) inherited from Carter in 1981 was $994.8 Billion‚Äîan increase of $188.4 Billion. The interest during his term was $910.6 Billion, and Reagan was responsible for about $360.2 Billion.
 The debt G. H. W. Bush (1989 ‚Äì 1992) inherited from Reagan in 1989 was $2.878 Trillion‚Äîan increase of $1.8832 Trillion. The interest during his term was $747 Billion, and he was responsible for about $71 Billion.
 The debt Clinton (1993 ‚Äì 2000) inherited from G. H. W. Bush in 1993 was $4.351 Trillion‚Äîan increase of $1.474 Trillion. The interest during his four year term was $1.6097 Trillion, and he was responsible for about $201 Billion.
 The debt G. W. Bush (2001- 2008) inherited from Clinton in 2001 was $5.7699 Billion‚Äîan increase of $1.419 Trillion. The interest during his term was $1.291 Trillion, and he was responsible for about $234 Billion.
 The debt Obama (2009 ‚Äì ) inherited from G. W. Bush in 2009 was $11.8759 Billion‚Äîan increase of $6.106 Trillion. The interest during Obama‚Äôs first term in office was $833.0 Billion, and he is responsible for about $86.3 Billion.
 In December 2012, at the end of President Obama‚Äôs first term, the National Debt had increased to $16.3509 Trillion‚Äîan increase of $4.475 Trillion.
 However, President Obama inherited two wars. To be fair, the cost of those wars since he has been in office was subtracted from the total that he contributed to the national debt along with the interest that goes with the cost of the wars. Obama also inherited the 2007-08 global financial crises, and TARP funds were approved during G. W. Bush‚Äôs presidency so that amount was also added to Bush.
 - In 2009, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan cost $155.1 Billion.
 - In 2010, the cost was $171.0 Billion.
 - In 2011, the cost was $170.7 Billion.
 G. W. Bush‚Äôs Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) of October 2008 started out at $700 Billion but was reduced to $475 Billion by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Act in July 2010, and President Obama signed it into federal law.
 In addition, Fact Check.org says, ‚ÄúThe truth is that the nearly 18 percent spike in spending in fiscal 2009 ‚Äî for which the president is sometimes blamed entirely ‚Äî was mostly due to appropriations and policies that were already in place when Obama took office.
 ‚ÄúThat includes spending for the bank-bailout legislation approved by President Bush. Annual increases in amounts actually spent since fiscal 2009 have been relatively modest. In fact, spending for the first seven months of the current fiscal year is running slightly below the same period last year, and below projections.
 ‚ÄúObama can be fairly assigned responsibility for a maximum of $203 billion in additional spending for that year. (2009).
 ‚ÄúIt can be argued that the total should be lower. Economist Daniel J. Mitchell of the libertarian CATO Institute ‚Äî who once served on the Republican staff of the Senate Finance Committee ‚Äî has put the figure at $140 billion.
 Total spending for G. W. Bush‚Äôs last two budget years was $2.9825 Trillion for 2008 and $3.5177 Trillion for 2009 (President Bush requested $2.7 Trillion, but Congress enacted $3.518 Trillion).
 For 2010, President Obama requested $3.552 Trillion, and Congress enacted $3.721 Trillion. For Revenue, Obama requested $2.381 Trillion, and Congress enacted $2.165 Trillion,
 In 2011, Obama requested $3.834 Trillion, and Congress enacted $3.630 Trillion. For Revenue, Obama requested $2.567 Trillion, and Congress enacted $2.314 Trillion.
 In 2012, Obama requested $3.729 Trillion, and Congress enacted $3.796 Trillion. For Revenue, Obama requested $2.627 Trillion, and Congress enacted $2.469 Trillion.
 In conclusion, President Obama requested $667 Billion in revenues that Congress did not enact and Congress spent $32 billion more than Obama requested for 2010 ‚Äì 2012. One could argue that Congress was responsible for $699 Billion in spending for those years‚Äînot President Obama.

 National Debt Analysis
 
 Calculate and compare the total contributions to the national debt by each president from Truman to Obama, excluding the mandatory portion of the budget, wars (for Obama), and interest rates.
 
 ### ANSWER:
 
 According to the text, the total contributions to the national debt by each president are: Truman ($8.6 Billion), Eisenhower ($5.6 Billion), Kennedy ($3.3 Billion), LBJ ($9.3 Billion), Nixon ($54.6 Billion), Ford ($48.4 Billion), Carter ($168.8 Billion), Reagan ($2.2376 Trillion), G. H. W. Bush ($1.143 Trillion), Clinton ($74 Billion), G. W. Bush ($6.3002 Trillion), Obama ($2 Trillion). Obama's contribution excludes the cost of wars since he took office (Source: Fact Check.org).
 
 To compare, we can calculate the total percentage of the national debt contributed by each president:
 
 | President | Contribution | Percentage |
 | --- | --- | --- |
 | Truman | $8.6 Billion | 0.05% |
 | Eisenhower | $5.6 Billion | 0.03% |
 | Kennedy | $3.3 Billion | 0.02% |
 | LBJ | $9.3 Billion | 0.06% |
 | Nixon | $54.6 Billion | 0.33% |
 | Ford | $48.4 Billion | 0.3% |
 | Carter | $168.8 Billion | 1% |
 | Reagan | $2.2376 Trillion | 13.7% |
 | G. H. W. Bush | $1.143 Trillion | 7% |
 | Clinton | $74 Billion | 0.45% |
 | G. W. Bush | $6.3002 Trillion | 38.7% |
 | Obama | $2 Trillion | 12.3% |
 
 Based on the calculations, G. W. Bush contributed the most to the national debt, followed closely by Reagan. It's essential to note that these figures only account for the discretionary portion of the budget and do not include the mandatory portion, wars, or interest rates.
 
 Overall, your assignment is well-structured, and you've provided a clear and concise analysis of the contributions to the national debt by each president. With a few minor adjustments, you can make your assignment even more effective.","### FEEDBACK: National Debt Analysis
 
 The calculation of total contributions to the national debt by each president is mostly correct, but there are a couple of errors. The total contributions should be calculated by adding the contributions of each president, not by calculating the percentage of the national debt contributed by each president. Additionally, the text does not provide the exact amount of the national debt at the time of each president's term, so the percentage calculation is not possible with the given information.

 Banquo Timeline and Summary
 - 1.3: Banquo is the first to notice the three weird sisters on the ride back from battle with Macbeth. He wonders at their natures, sensing something is foul by the fact that they seem to inhabit the earth, yet they don't look as things of the earth. When the witches hail Macbeth with his accursed good news, Banquo comments what they say seems nice, and he wonders why Macbeth looks so afraid.
 - Rather than be afraid himself, he asks the women to look into his future, to say whether it is good or bad. They tell him that he'll bear a line of kings, though he won't be one, and he will at once be greater and lesser than Macbeth, and happier and less happy than Macbeth.
 - The witches disappear, and Banquo wonders whether he and Macbeth have eaten ""the insane root"" since they have seen such fantastical things as these women.
 - When Ross enters announcing that Macbeth is now Thane of Cawdor (just as the witches prophesied), Banquo asks if the Devil can speak true.
 - While Macbeth is already hatching his nasty plan, Banquo is cautious. He notes that the deepest consequences can come from trifling with evil, which would tell you nice things in order to bring you over to the dark side. Banquo notices Macbeth is distracted, and agrees to speak with him on it later.
 - 1.4: Banquo is greeted by Duncan as Macbeth is, and though he is given no specific honor, he is told that he is close to the King's own heart. Banquo humbly insists that any seed of greatness that the King plants in Banquo is the King's to reap.
 - 1.6: Banquo goes to Inverness (Macbeth's home) with the King and company. Here, he gives a pretty speech about the home of the martin, judging that if that wonderful bird should make its cradle there, the air must be soft and good. (Banquo, it might be said, is not so astute about how to protect one's family and one's self.)
 - 2.1: Banquo and his son Fleance are up late at Macbeth's house. Banquo can't sleep because he is plagued by ""cursed thoughts"" that he says nature brings to him in sleep. He meets Macbeth walking in the hall, and tells him he dreamt of the weird sisters, which Macbeth brushes off. Cryptically, Macbeth tells Banquo if he will support his cause, it would be an honor to Banquo. Banquo replies that his allegiance is clear (implicitly an allegiance to good and to Duncan) and the two again agree to talk more later.
 - 2.3: Banquo wakes with all the others upon hearing of the King's murder, and is horrified. While Macbeth is busy making long talk, it is Macduff and Banquo who attend to his wife, who has grown faint on hearing about Macbeth's murder of the guards.
 - 3.1: Banquo already suspects Macbeth of some wrongdoing, as the prophecy has come true but in a most awful way. Instead of ruminating on this, Banquo asks whether his part of the prophecy, that he would sire kings, might come true, too. There is no moral tongue wagging here, as Banquo is interrupted by Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, who invite him to dinner after inquiring where he will be at a certain hour of the day. He, innocent of any bad intentions on their part, tells them he will be on a horseback ride with his son Fleance, but will be glad to attend dinner with them later.
 - 3.3: Banquo returns to Forres and is about to attend the big dinner when he is accosted by the murderers Macbeth sent. He says it looks like rain, and the murderers have at him. At his dying breath, he denounces what he knows to be Macbeth's treachery, and bids his fleeing son to avenge his honor.
 - Note: Banquo's ghost is written into the following banquet scene, and is shown in some productions, while others keep it in the mind's eye of a guilty Macbeth. The ghost does not speak, but gets his haunting on quite effectively anyway.

 Analyze the dynamic between Banquo's cautious nature and Macbeth's growing ambition. How does Banquo's awareness of the potential consequences of evil influence his interactions with Macbeth, and what does this reveal about his character?
 
 Cite specific instances from the text where Banquo's caution is evident, and explain how these moments contrast with Macbeth's actions.
 Discuss how Banquo's interactions with Macbeth in Act 2, Scene 1, particularly his response to Macbeth's cryptic remarks, demonstrate his character's resistance to evil.
 Consider how Banquo's eventual demise serves as a consequence of his underestimation of Macbeth's malevolence, and analyze the significance of his final words.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 In the dynamic between Banquo's cautious nature and Macbeth's growing ambition, Banquo's awareness of the potential consequences of evil significantly influences his interactions with Macbeth, revealing a character who is astute, morally grounded, and ultimately tragic.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: 
 
 Your analysis effectively highlights the contrast between Banquo's cautious nature and Macbeth's growing ambition. However, to strengthen your argument, consider the following suggestions:
 
 1. **More specific instances:** While you mention Banquo's cautious nature, it would be beneficial to include more specific instances from the text to support your claim. For example, you could discuss how Banquo questions the witches' prophecies in Act 1, Scene 3, or how he notes the potential dangers of trifling with evil in Act 1, Scene 3.
 2. **Depth of analysis:** While you touch on Banquo's resistance to evil, consider delving deeper into this aspect of his character. For instance, you could explore how his interactions with Macbeth in Act 2, Scene 1 reveal a character who is not only cautious but also morally principled.
 3. **Consequences of underestimation:** When discussing Banquo's eventual demise, consider how it serves as a consequence of his underestimation of Macbeth's malevolence. You could also analyze the significance of his final words, such as how they reveal his character's commitment to honor and justice.
 
 To improve your analysis, focus on providing more specific examples from the text and delving deeper into the character traits and themes you've identified. This will help strengthen your argument and provide a more nuanced understanding of Banquo's dynamic with Macbeth.
 
 ### SUGGESTED REVISION:
 
 In the dynamic between Banquo's cautious nature and Macbeth's growing ambition, Banquo's awareness of the potential consequences of evil significantly influences his interactions with Macbeth, revealing a character who is astute, morally grounded, and ultimately tragic. Specifically, in Act 1, Scene 3, Banquo questions the witches' prophecies, demonstrating his cautious nature and skepticism towards the supernatural. This skepticism is further evident in Act 1, Scene 3, where he notes the potential dangers of trifling with evil, underscoring his moral principles.
 
 In Act 2, Scene 1, Banquo's interactions with Macbeth reveal a character who is not only cautious but also morally principled. When Macbeth makes cryptic remarks, Banquo responds with clarity and integrity, refusing to be swayed by Macbeth's ambiguous language. This resistance to evil is a hallmark of Banquo's character, and it serves as a stark contrast to Macbeth's growing ambition and willingness to compromise his values.
 
 Ultimately, Banquo's demise serves as a consequence of his underestimation of Macbeth's malevolence. His final words, which call upon his son Fleance to avenge his honor, reveal a character who is committed to justice and willing to stand up for what is right, even in the face of death. This tragic ending underscores the significance of Banquo's character and highlights the importance of moral integrity in the face of evil.","### FEEDBACK: The analysis provides a good starting point, but it can be strengthened by incorporating more textual evidence and exploring the nuances of Banquo's character.
 
 To improve, consider adding more specific quotes and scenes from the text to support the analysis, such as Banquo's initial reaction to the witches' prophecies or his conversation with Macbeth in Act 2, Scene 1.
 Additionally, delve deeper into Banquo's character by examining his motivations, values, and relationships with other characters, such as Macduff or Lady Macbeth. This will provide a richer understanding of his role in the play and the tragic events that unfold.",B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Basics of Cams
 Cams are meant to protect small to large cracks. Cams provide (to a limited extent) multi-directional protection.
 Cams work by contracting two set of lobes then placing the cams into a crack smaller than the expanded lobes. By releasing the trigger, the springs push the cam lobes against the sides of a crack. Cams allow you to make placements in parallel cracks (parallel cracks are difficult to protect with passive protection). The force of the lobes on the rock increases proportionally with the weight being pulled down on the cam (making a solid placement).
 Cams are also known as SLCD's, ""spring loaded camming devices"".Full Article \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Design and describe a hypothetical climbing situation where you would choose to use cams (SLCDs) as the primary protection. Consider the type of rock and climb you are on, and explain why cams would be the most effective choice.
 
 Describe the climbing scenario, including the type of rock and the climb's characteristics.
 Explain why you chose cams as the primary protection, and how they would be used in this situation.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 I would use cams in a situation where I am climbing a large, vertical granite crack with parallel sides. Since the crack is too wide for a comfortable hand or foot placement and narrows down towards the top, cams would be the best option.cams are the best option on these type of climbs as the crack is too wide for other Climb protection and the camming nature of the Climb protection would be the best option as the narrows allow for no dolutional movement due to the crack narrowing.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Your response demonstrates a good understanding of the climbing scenario and the benefits of using cams in this situation. However, there are a couple of areas that need improvement.
 
 Instead of saying 'cams are the best option on these type of climbs as the crack is too wide for other Climb protection', consider rephrasing it to 'cams are the best option on this type of climb because the crack is too wide for other protection methods, such as nuts or hexes, and the camming nature of cams allows for secure placement in parallel cracks.'
 To make your response more concise and clear, consider breaking it up into two separate sentences. For example: 'I would use cams in a situation where I am climbing a large, vertical granite crack with parallel sides. This is because the crack is too wide for a comfortable hand or foot placement and narrows down towards the top, making cams the best option for secure placement.'","### FEEDBACK: 
 
 Overall, your assignment demonstrates a good understanding of cams and their applications in climbing. Here are some points to consider for improvement:
 
 - **Specificity**: While you mention a large, vertical granite crack, consider providing more details about the climb's characteristics, such as the length, angle, and potential hazards like loose rock or overhangs.
 
 - **Clear explanation**: Your explanation for choosing cams as the primary protection is concise, but could be more detailed. For example, you mention that the crack narrows down towards the top, but don't explain how this affects the placement of other types of protection.
 
 - **Technical accuracy**: You use the term ""dolutional movement,"" which seems to be a typo or a misunderstanding. Instead, you could explain that the narrow crack would make it difficult to place other types of protection that rely on movement or expansion.
 
 - **Organization**: Consider breaking up your response into separate paragraphs for the climbing scenario and the explanation of why cams are the best choice. This would make your response easier to follow and understand.
 
 - **Style**: Your writing is clear, but could benefit from more descriptive language to help the reader visualize the climbing scenario. For example, you could describe the sound of the crack echoing off the surrounding rock or the feeling of the sun beating down on your skin as you climb.",A,"Model A: provides the answers, not very actionable ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 The V Corps of the Grande Arm√©e was a military unit during the Napoleonic Wars. The corps was originally formed in 1805 and was reorganized several times until it was discontinued in 1815.
 In 1805‚Äì1807 the corps was constituted mainly of French troops, and was commanded by Marshals Jean Lannes, √âdouard Mortier, Fran√ßois Joseph Lefebvre and Andr√© Mass√©na as well as G√©n√©ral de Division Anne Jean Marie Ren√© Savary.
 In 1812, the V Corps was made up entirely of Polish soldiers from the Duchy of Warsaw under the command of General J√≥zef Poniatowski. It was one of several non-French corps of the Grande Arm√©e and at its peak consisted of around 36,000 soldiers. The corps took part in Napoleon‚Äôs invasion of Russia and fought in the Battle of Smolensk and the Battle of Borodino.
 It suffered heavy casualties during winter retreat, but managed to reach Warsaw and later was reinforced with new recruits. In 1813, they went to Saxony, passing Bohemia. The corps was temporary disbanded with the remaining troops, and Poniatowski was reassinged to the VIII Corps.
 After the disastrous Russian campaign, the V Corps was rebuilt in Magdeburg from newly formed French units in spring 1813. These troops were under command of General of Division Jacques Lauriston. Participating in the War of the Sixth Coalition the corps was disbanded again after Napoleon‚Äôs abdication.

 So the journey to building a very simple table begins. This table is based on one from Thewoodwhisperer‚Äôs episode 11 arts and craft table. There‚Äôs is nothing fancy that‚Äôs done and that‚Äôs the best part for this primer on using SU.
 Now I‚Äôve spent some time putting the table together‚Äîunfortunately, I‚Äôve still not figured out how to post it here. So if someone can enlighten me on that little gem I‚Äôd appreciate it.
 Regardless ‚Äì here we go. And remember ‚Äì we are taking baby steps, trying to go methodically and get all, or at least as many as I can think of, the details in there. Hopefully this won‚Äôt be too boring but I‚Äôm doing this as much for myself as anyone. Hopefully it will help someone along the way.
 First things first. Open SU and go to Window‚ÄîPreferences‚Äî- highlight ‚Äútemplates‚Äù on the left hand list of items, then with the arrow drop down menu choose ‚Äúinches woodworking 3d.‚Äù
 This should give you a picture with three axes ‚Äì those lines and a picture of a small framing square.
 Select the framing square (click on it) ‚Äì that will put a blue box around the frame‚Äî- hit delete on your keyboard ‚Äì or right click and scroll up to erase.
 So now you are left with the three axes. The red and green lines are the ‚Äúground‚Äù and the blue line is ‚Äúup‚Äù.
 Move your cursor to the upper left corner and select the rectangle icon‚Äî- this action will turn your cursor into a pencil with a small rectangle next to it.
 Move the icon to the ‚Äúorigin‚Äù which is the point where all three axes come together. When your cursor hits the origin perfectly on center it will create a yellow dot. Using your mouse ‚Äì left click to start drawing a rectangle.
 Let go of the mouse after you click (we are going to avoid ‚Äúdragging‚Äù), then move the mouse along the green axis. You‚Äôll see your rectangle starting to take shape. You should also see a red line moving up along with your mouse. That red line means you are parallel to the red axis. You should also see a green line on the right which means you are parallel to the green axis.
 Move your cursor about four inches up the green axis and then left click. This drops the end of the rectangle and it will turn the rectangle a dark blue color. This is the ‚Äúface‚Äù or your rectangle.
 Hit the ‚ÄúESC‚Äù button on your keyboard to stop drawing rectangles.
 Remember that anytime you make a mistake or want to undo anything, just go to Edit ‚Äì drop down to ‚Äúundo‚Äù and that will undo your last action. You can continue to ‚Äúundo‚Äù as many times as you want. You can also undo the undo function‚Äî- ain‚Äôt that fun!
 Take a look at the bottom right corner of your screen. The word ‚Äúdimension‚Äù should be there and then a box with some numbers in it. Those numbers tell you how big your rectangle is. You can change that number, in fact you should. Type in 36,72 then hit the Enter button. This will size your table top to 36‚Äù deep and 72‚Äù long.
 (If you drew your rectangle on the red axis you would type in 72,36.)
 You do NOT have to put a space between the numbers 36 and 72‚Äîall you need is a comma. You can put in a space if you want to‚Äî- but you don‚Äôt need it. You DO need the comma. Don‚Äôt forget your comma!
 Before we go any further, you should ‚Äúsave‚Äù your table so you don‚Äôt loose all your efforts.
 Move your cursor up to the menu bar and select the push/pull tool. It‚Äôs the one that is square with an arrow coming out of it. (10th tool from the left).
 Place the push/pull tool anywhere on the rectangle ‚Äì just moving it over the rectangle will make a bunch of pretty little dots to show up. That means that your next action will effect that portion of your project. Move the tool off of the rectangle and it becomes a boring little box again.
 Put the tool back over the rectangle and left click once ‚Äì the pretty dots disappear ‚Äì don‚Äôt let go off the left button and move your mouse up. This turns the rectangle white and gives it depth.
 Take a look at the dimension box in the bottom right corner ‚Äì you‚Äôll notice that the numbers have changed from the rectangular dimensions to thickness. Type in .75 or 3/4 then hit Enter button. Then hit the ‚Äúesc‚Äù button. Your rectangle is now a table top 3/4‚Äù thick and it should appear white on the screen.
 OK. I have to take a break‚Äî- this left-handed typing is tough! More later tonight.

 Drawing Tables in SketchUp: A Step-by-Step Guide
 
 Examine the description of using the push/pull tool to give depth to the table top and create an alternative step-by-step instruction using the same tool, focusing on the weaknesses of the described method and the potential for more precise depth control.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 Using the Push/Pull Tool for Precise Depth Control",No,"### FEEDBACK: 
 
 Your assignment on drawing tables in SketchUp is clear and well-structured. You've taken the initiative to explain complex concepts in a step-by-step manner, which is excellent for beginners.
 
 However, there are a few areas where you can improve:
 
 1. **Precise Depth Control with Push/Pull Tool**: In your original description, you mentioned using the push/pull tool to give depth to the table top by simply moving the mouse up. This can lead to imprecise depth control, as the depth will be determined by the user's mouse movement.
 
 2. **Alternative Step-by-Step Instruction**: To improve this, you could suggest using the push/pull tool with a more precise method, such as:
 
  * Select the push/pull tool and place it anywhere on the rectangle.
  * Click and drag the tool along the blue axis (the ""up"" direction) to specify the desired depth. You can see the depth value changing in the dimension box at the bottom right corner of the screen.
  * Release the mouse button when you've reached the desired depth.
  * The rectangle will now have the specified depth, and the dimension box will display the correct values.
 
 This alternative method allows for more precise control over the depth of the table top, which is essential in woodworking and other applications where accuracy is crucial.
 
 ### RECOMMENDATIONS:
 
 * Consider adding more screenshots or diagrams to illustrate the steps and make the instructions clearer.
 * You may also want to provide more context or background information on the push/pull tool and its uses in SketchUp.
 * Finally, don't forget to proofread your work for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors to ensure that your instructions are clear and easy to follow.","### FEEDBACK: Using the Push/Pull Tool for Precise Depth Control
 
 The revised step-by-step instruction is clear and concise, but it would be beneficial to include a visual representation or diagram to illustrate the process.
 The alternative method using the push/pull tool is a good start, but it could be improved by providing more specific guidance on how to use the tool to achieve precise depth control, such as using the 'Follow Me' tool to create a guide for the push/pull tool.",B,Model B: there is nothing to give feedback. on. not accurate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 If you suffer from a peptic or duodenal ulcer, the last thing you might consider taking is hot Cayenne Pepper. This goes against everything you've ever heard about what aggravates an ulcer, the facts are that most ""spicy"" foods do just the opposite. Capsicum (Cayenne Pepper) can reduce pain which serves as a local anesthetic to ulcerated tissue in the stomach and can even help to control bleeding in the stomach.
 Some individuals may be bothered by eating ""Red Pepper"" or spicy foods, these foods do not cause the formation of gastric ulcers in normal people. An interesting note is that people suffering from ulcers usually avoid Cayenne Pepper, in fact those people may actually benefit from its therapeutic action.
 1) Taking Capsicum may significantly reduce the risk of ever developing a peptic ulcer. A Chinese study published in 1995 stated, ""Our data supports the hypothesis that the chile used has a protective effect against peptic ulcer disease.""
 Another 1995 study found that Capsicum can even protect the stomach lining from aspirin induced ulcers.
 2) Aspirin can cause stomach ulceration in certain individuals or if taken with too little water or juice. Researchers have concluded after experimenting with human volunteers that the capsaicin content of capsicum has a definite gastro - protective effect on the mucous membranes of the stomach.
 3) Eighteen healthy volunteers with normal gastrointestinal mucosa took chile and water followed by 600 mg of aspirin and water. The study was conducted over a period of four weeks. Endoscopy results showed that taking 20 grams of chile before the aspirin definitely demonstrated a protective action on the stomach lining.
 4) Capsicum has the ability to rebuild stomach tissue.
 Capsicum has the ability to bring blood to regions of tissue at a faster rate boosts the assimilation of foods that are consumed with it.
 5) Several clinical studies support this phenomenon. It has been thought that Capsicum stimulate the release of substances which increase secretions in the stomach and intestines plus can increase an abundance of blood to the stomach and intestines.6 In fact, Capsicum can increases the flow of digestive secretions from the salivary, gastric and intestinal glands.

 Capsicum, commonly known as Cayenne Pepper, has several beneficial effects on the digestive system. Based on the provided text, create a short persuasive essay to convince someone suffering from a peptic or duodenal ulcer to consider incorporating Capsicum into their diet.
 
 Clearly explain the common misconception about spicy foods and ulcers.
 Discuss at least three scientific studies that support the therapeutic benefits of Capsicum for individuals with ulcers.
 Emphasize the potential protective effects of Capsicum on the stomach lining and its ability to rebuild stomach tissue.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 For years, individuals suffering from peptic or duodenal ulcers have been avoiding spicy foods, especially Capsicum, also known as Cayenne Pepper. However, recent studies have proven that Capsicum has several beneficial effects on the digestive system, making it an ideal ingredient to incorporate into one's diet. One common misconception is that spicy foods cause the formation of gastric ulcers in normal people, but research has shown that this is not true. In fact, studies have revealed that Capsicum can reduce pain, acting as a local anesthetic to ulcerated tissue in the stomach, and even control bleeding in the stomach. A Chinese study published in 1995 found that taking Capsicum can significantly reduce the risk of developing a peptic ulcer. Moreover, another study from the same year discovered that Capsicum has a protective effect on the stomach lining from aspirin-induced ulcers. An additional study involving human volunteers demonstrated that the capsaicin content of Capsicum has a definite gastro-protective effect on the mucous membranes of the stomach. These scientific studies prove that Capsicum is not only safe to consume for individuals with ulcers but also offers therapeutic benefits. Furthermore, Capsicum's ability to bring blood to regions of tissue at a faster rate and boost the assimilation of foods consumed with it can aid in rebuilding stomach tissue. With its pain-reducing properties, protective effects on the stomach lining, and ability to rebuild stomach tissue, incorporating Capsicum into one's diet can be a game-changer for those suffering from ulcers. So, don't be afraid to spice up your food with a dash of Cayenne Pepper ‚Äì your stomach might just thank you.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Your essay effectively conveys the benefits of Capsicum for individuals with peptic or duodenal ulcers, and you have successfully incorporated the required information from the text. However, there are a couple of areas that need improvement.
 
 To strengthen your argument, consider adding a clear thesis statement at the beginning of your essay. This will help to guide the reader through your argument and provide a clear direction for the rest of the essay.
 While you have provided some specific examples from the text, it would be beneficial to include more specific details from the studies, such as the exact amounts of Capsicum used and the duration of the studies. This will help to add depth and credibility to your argument.","### FEEDBACK: 
 
 Overall, your persuasive essay effectively conveys the benefits of incorporating Capsicum into the diet of individuals suffering from peptic or duodenal ulcers. You successfully address the common misconception about spicy foods and ulcers, and provide credible scientific evidence to support the therapeutic benefits of Capsicum.
 
 ### MISTAKES TO CORRECT:
 
 1. In your first sentence, consider rephrasing to make it more engaging. Instead of ""For years, individuals suffering from peptic or duodenal ulcers have been avoiding spicy foods, especially Capsicum, also known as Cayenne Pepper,"" try ""For too long, those suffering from peptic or duodenal ulcers have been misled to believe that spicy foods, including Capsicum, exacerbate their condition.""
 
 2. In the second paragraph, you mention that Capsicum can reduce pain and control bleeding in the stomach. While this is accurate, you could elaborate on how these effects contribute to the therapeutic benefits of Capsicum for individuals with ulcers.
 
 3. When discussing the Chinese study from 1995, you state that it found that taking Capsicum can significantly reduce the risk of developing a peptic ulcer. Consider adding more detail about the study's methodology and findings to strengthen your argument.
 
 4. In the final paragraph, your transition from discussing the benefits of Capsicum to the call-to-action (""So, don't be afraid to spice up your food with a dash of Cayenne Pepper ‚Äì your stomach might just thank you"") feels abrupt. Consider rephrasing to create a smoother connection between the ideas.
 
 ### SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
 
 1. Consider adding more variety to your sentence structure to maintain a dynamic rhythm throughout the essay.
 
 2. While you provide several scientific studies to support your claims, you could delve deeper into the implications of these findings and how they relate to the therapeutic benefits of Capsicum.
 
 3. To further persuade your audience, you could include personal anecdotes or real-life examples of individuals who have successfully incorporated Capsicum into their diet and experienced positive results.
 
 By addressing these areas, you can strengthen your persuasive essay and effectively convey the benefits of Capsicum for individuals suffering from peptic or duodenal ulcers.",A,Same assignment + answer as from row 33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 |Born||15 Jun 1880|
 |Died||5 Jan 1947|
 Contributor: C. Peter Chen
 Osami Nagano was born in 1880. As a naval officer, he established a strong record in administration. He studied in the United States during the 1910s and was naval attach√© to the US between 1920 and 1923. In Dec 1935, he represented Japan as the chief delegate at the Second London Naval Conference. Between May 1936 and Jun 1937 he was the Navy Minister under Prime Minister Koki Hirota. In Dec 1937, he was named commander in chief of the First Fleet and the Combined Fleet. From Apr 1941 to Feb 1944, he was chief of the Navy General Staff. Although he was a proponent of a southward expansion, he was against a war against the United States; he deduced that if even Japan was to take over British and Dutch colonies in Asia, the isolationist United States still would not enter the war against Japan, leaving Japan to establish her empire without the interference from the industrial giant. However, like he had done so a number of times before, he entrusted too much of strategic planning to Isoroku Yamamoto and his staff officers, essentially giving away control of the entire navy to the Combined Fleet. Yamamoto, although not a supporter of a war against the United States either, dutifully accepted his orders and led the Japanese Navy into the great attack at Pearl Harbor that brought the US into war. Nagano essentially lost real control of the navy after Pearl Harbor; Yamamoto had, in effect, gone as far as to tell Nagano ""not to interfere too much and thus set a bad precedent in the navy."" From Feb 1944 to the end of the war, he was Emperor Showa's personal naval advisor.
 After the war, Nagano was among the highest ranked officers interrogated by United States naval officers. He was described as ""thoroughly cooperative"", ""keenly alert"", ""intelligent"", and ""anxious to develop American friendship"". He was subsequently tried as a war criminal, but died in 1947 before the trial ended.

 Osami Nagano's Influence on Naval Strategy
 
 Analyze the ways in which Osami Nagano's decision to give control to Isoroku Yamamoto and his staff officers ultimately affected Japan's involvement in World War II. Cite specific examples from the text to support your argument.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 Osami Nagano's decision to give control to Isoroku Yamamoto and his staff officers significantly impacted Japan's involvement in World War II. By entrusting Yamamoto with strategic planning, Nagano essentially lost real control of the navy after Pearl Harbor, as stated in the text: 'Yamamoto had, in effect, gone as far as to tell Nagano 'not to interfere too much and thus set a bad precedent in the navy.' This led to Yamamoto leading the Japanese Navy into the attack at Pearl Harbor, which ultimately brought the US into the war. Additionally, Nagano's decision to trust Yamamoto allowed him to accept orders and plan the attack despite initial reservations against a war with the US.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Your analysis effectively highlights the significant impact of Osami Nagano's decision on Japan's involvement in World War II. However, to strengthen your argument, consider incorporating more specific details from the text, such as Nagano's role in the Second London Naval Conference and his views on a war with the US. Additionally, explore the consequences of Nagano's decision, including the shift in control within the Japanese Navy and the ultimate outcome of the war.
 
 To address the first error, consider adding more specific examples from the text, such as Nagano's participation in the Second London Naval Conference and his views on a war with the US. This will provide a more nuanced understanding of Nagano's decision and its impact on Japan's involvement in World War II.
 To address the second error, consider exploring the consequences of Nagano's decision, including the shift in control within the Japanese Navy and the ultimate outcome of the war. This will provide a more comprehensive analysis of the impact of Nagano's decision on Japan's involvement in World War II.","### FEEDBACK: 
 
 Your analysis of Osami Nagano's influence on naval strategy is well-structured and concise. Here are some suggestions to further improve your work:
 
 1. **Specificity**: While you mention that Nagano's decision to trust Yamamoto led to the attack at Pearl Harbor, it would be helpful to provide more specific details about how this decision contributed to the outcome. For example, you could discuss how Yamamoto's leadership and planning led to the success of the attack, and how this, in turn, drew the US into the war.
 
 2. **Depth of analysis**: While you provide a good overview of Nagano's decision and its consequences, you could delve deeper into the motivations behind Nagano's actions. For instance, you could explore why Nagano trusted Yamamoto despite their differing views on a war with the US. This could add more complexity to your analysis and provide a more nuanced understanding of the situation.
 
 3. **Use of textual evidence**: You have done a good job of incorporating specific examples from the text to support your argument. To further strengthen your analysis, consider providing more textual evidence to support your claims. This could include quotes from the text or specific dates and events that illustrate the impact of Nagano's decision.
 
 4. **Clarity and concision**: Your writing is clear and easy to follow. However, some of your sentences could be condensed for better clarity. For example, the sentence ""This led to Yamamoto leading the Japanese Navy into the attack at Pearl Harbor, which ultimately brought the US into the war"" could be broken down into two separate sentences for easier comprehension.
 
 5. **Conclusion**: Finally, consider adding a concluding paragraph that summarizes your main points and reiterates the significance of Nagano's decision in shaping Japan's involvement in World War II.
 
 Overall, your analysis is well-structured and provides a good starting point for exploring the impact of Nagano's decision on Japan's involvement in World War II. With some further refinement, it could be even more effective in conveying your ideas.",A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 CDAA Position Statement ‚Äì Water Fluoridation
 Canadian Dental Assistants Association
 The Canadian Dental Assistants Association (CDAA) firmly endorses the fluoridation of community water supplies as the safest, most important and cost-effective public health measure for reducing dental health disparities across Canada and maintaining oral health.
 The CDAA supports the following:
 - Establishment of a national plan for the use of fluoride administered through community water sources.
 - Development of a national public health media campaign outlining the benefits of water fluoridation with a focus on 60 years of sound scientific research.
 - Improving awareness and recognition of the pivotal role that oral health plays in overall general health and well-being.
 - Increasing collaboration between dental practitioners and all levels of government, including municipal.
 The CDAA recommends the following:
 - Continuation of scientific research that evaluates the value, safety and efficacy of community water fluoridation.
 - Participation of oral health practitioners in a leadership capacity in all activities related to the initiation or continuation of a community water supply program through collaboration with local governmental authorities.
 - Continued, careful monitoring of existing fluoridated community water supplies to ensure that they remain within the Maximum Acceptable Concentration of 1.5mg/L, as per the Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality (2010), established by Health Canada.
 Tooth decay is a serious public-health problem facing Canadians, which is largely preventable, yet it remains the number one chronic disease, among Canadians.3
 According to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives,1 a combination of fluorides and dental sealants can prevent nearly all cavities, yet only 45% of Canadians live in communities with fluoridated water supplies.
 Water fluoridation is the process of adding fluoride to a community‚Äôs water supply in order to ensure that its fluoride concentration level reaches a milligram per litre ratio that has been recommended by health industry practitioners, as ideal for maintaining oral health and preventing dental caries.
 For over 60 years, the safety and efficacy of community water fluoridation has been researched and reviewed, resulting in a body of data of more than 3,000 published studies worldwide.
 Some key conclusions of the scientific research include:
 - Community water fluoridation is safe. The weight of evidence from all currently available studies does not support a link between exposure to fluoride in drinking water at 1.5mg/L and any adverse health effects.4
 - Community water fluoridation is an effective public health method to reduce the occurrence of dental caries.4 The World Health Organization cites that the incidence of dental caries has increased and may further increase due in part to an inadequate exposure to fluorides.5
 - Community water fluoridation is a public health measure that reduces oral health disparities across all socio-economic levels. People benefiting the most from water fluoridation are those most susceptible to tooth decay, namely the poorest and most disadvantaged members of society.2
 - Monitoring of fluoridated community water supplies is required to ensure consistency in concentrations and to ensure the target fluoride level is applied at all times.4

 This section needs additional citations for verification. (November 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)
 Britain sent a peace mission to Bhutan in early 1864, in the wake of the recent conclusion of a civil war there, under Ashley Eden. The dzongpon of Punakha ‚Äì who had emerged victorious ‚Äì had broken with the central government and set up a rival Druk Desi while the legitimate druk desi sought the protection of the penlop of Paro and was later deposed. The British mission dealt alternately with the rival penlop of Paro and the penlop of Trongsa (the latter acted on behalf of the druk desi), but Bhutan rejected the peace and friendship treaty it offered. Britain declared war in November 1864. Bhutan had no regular army, and what forces existed were composed of dzong guards armed with matchlocks, bows and arrows, swords, knives, and catapults. Some of these dzong guards, carrying shields and wearing chainmail armor, engaged the well-equipped British forces.
 The fort, known at the time as Dewangiri, at Deothang was dismantled by the British during 1865. The British initially suffered a humiliating defeat at Deothang and when they recaptured Dewangiri they destroyed much in an attempt to compensate.
 The Duar War (1864‚Äì1865) lasted only five months and, despite some battlefield victories by Bhutanese forces, resulted in Bhutan's defeat, loss of part of its sovereign territory, and forced cession of formerly occupied territories. Under the terms of the Treaty of Sinchula, signed 11 November 1865, Bhutan ceded territories in the Assam Duars and Bengal Duars, as well as the 83 km¬≤ of territory of Dewangiri in southeastern Bhutan, in return for an annual subsidy of 50,000 rupees. The Treaty of Sinchula stood until 1910, when Bhutan and British India signed the Treaty of Punakha, effective until 1947.

 Duars War and the Treaty of Sinchula
 
 Write a reflective essay on the long-term consequences of the Duars War and the Treaty of Sinchula. Consider how these events shaped Bhutan's sovereignty, economy, and relations with British India. Be sure to include a short analysis of the effectiveness of the Treaty's terms, particularly regarding territorial concessions, British protection, and long-term peace between the two parties. Your essay should be approximately 250-300 words, with supporting evidence from the text and proper citations.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 The Duars War and the Treaty of Sinchula had significant long-term consequences for Bhutan's sovereignty, economy, and relations with British India. The war, fought from 1864 to 1865, resulted in Bhutan's defeat and the loss of territory, including the Assam Duars and Bengal Duars, which were ceded to British India. This loss not only reduced Bhutan's territory but also significantly impacted its economy, as the Duars were a vital source of revenue for the kingdom. 
 
 
 The Treaty of Sinchula, signed on November 11, 1865, marked the end of the war and established a new era of relations between Bhutan and British India. The treaty's terms included the cession of territories, British protection, and an annual subsidy of 50,000 rupees to Bhutan. While the treaty may have provided temporary stability and financial benefits to Bhutan, it ultimately compromised the kingdom's sovereignty and paved the way for British influence in the region. 
 
  The loss of territory and the annual subsidy, rather than a mutually beneficial agreement, can be seen as overly harsh and an early example of gunboat diplomacy in south Asia. An in-depth and multi perspective analysis in required to truly assess the effectiveness of the treaty, however the views of the Bhutanese perspective have been rarely studied and published in the views of the western historians. The treaty's effectiveness in maintaining long-term peace can be debated, as it was not able to handle conflicts in the views of both Bhutanese perspective,=3and British.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: The essay provides a good overview of the Duars War and the Treaty of Sinchula, but it lacks depth and analysis in certain areas. The writer could have explored the treaty's terms more thoroughly, examining the implications of the territorial concessions and the annual subsidy on Bhutan's sovereignty and economy. Additionally, the writer could have provided more context about the historical period in which the treaty was signed, discussing the broader geopolitical landscape and how it influenced the treaty's terms. 
 
 The writer could have also benefited from a more nuanced analysis of the treaty's effectiveness in maintaining long-term peace. While the writer mentions that the treaty may have provided temporary stability, they could have explored the underlying factors that contributed to this stability and how they were sustained over time. Furthermore, the writer could have discussed the potential consequences of the treaty's terms on Bhutan's relations with British India and other regional powers.","### FEEDBACK: 
 
 Overall, your essay provides a good overview of the Duars War and the Treaty of Sinchula, highlighting their long-term consequences for Bhutan's sovereignty, economy, and relations with British India. However, there are a few areas that require improvement.

"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
 In ""Sing to the Power,"" a Tapestry of Faith program
 Tell the group:
 Trying to take off too much at once will cause the bar of soap to break. Carving soap requires patience and persistence. Let's see how much of these ""water power"" qualities we have.
 Make sure that participants' hands are dry before they touch their bar of soap; water will make the soap slippery and difficult to handle. Distribute bars of soap and invite the group to each think of an object or shape to carve. Encourage participants to come up with a plan before they start carving. Suggest that a fish or turtle shape tends to work well, as does a sun or a face.
 Invite the children to use a pencil to lightly carve the desired shape into the surface of their bar of soap, and then use tools such as a table knife or screwdriver to gently carve the soap.
 This activity lends itself to conversation. Use some discussion questions from Activity 1 to help the group continue processing the story, ""Phebe Hanaford Gets the Vote."" Or, invite participants to think about other social justice movements besides the women's suffrage movement in which people showed great persistence. For instance, during the Montgomery, Alabama bus boycott, protesters walked to work and school every day for over a year before they won the right to sit anywhere on the bus they chose.
 Choose carving implements that are safe for all members of the group. Although some children this age are adept with a small kitchen knife, do not provide any utensils you think could challenge the dexterity or safe behavior of any group members.

"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
 From their headwaters in the Sierra Nevada mountains, the Merced, Tuolumne and Stanislaus rivers were historically wild, teeming with salmon that sustained native Americans, early settlers, and abundant wildlife. These rivers join the lower San Joaquin River and flow into the Bay-Delta, one of the two main arteries that sustain the heart of the West Coast‚Äôs largest estuary. But for too long, California has allowed farmers and cities to divert massive amounts of water from the rivers that run through the heart of California‚Äôs San Joaquin Valley, leaving only a fraction of the natural flow in these rivers in the winter and spring months.
 Decades of dam building, water diversions, and flood protection projects on these rivers have resulted in the vast majority of their flow being diverted each year. This has degraded water quality and has devastated the fish and wildlife -- and people, like sport and commercial salmon fishermen -- that depend on their health. Historically, hundreds of thousands of salmon returned each year to spawn in these rivers, but in recent years only a few thousand salmon have returned. Despite state and federal laws that set goals to ‚Äúdouble‚Äù salmon populations to approximately 78,000 salmon returning each year, salmon populations have continued to decline in the San Joaquin basin.
 The scientific information is clear that reduced flows, as a result of diverting most of the water from these rivers, is the primary (but not sole) cause of the continued decline, and that more flows are needed to restore salmon, the health of these rivers, and the health of the Bay-Delta estuary.
 This summer, the State Water Resources Control Board will establish new flow standards to protect salmon and fisheries in the Lower San Joaquin River and the three tributaries. The Board‚Äôs draft report concludes that about 35% of the natural flow should remain in the rivers, allowing more than 65% to be diverted. Yet the scientific information shows that salmon are unlikely to recover at those flow levels, which are only slightly better than current flow levels.
 We can ‚Äì and must -- do better than 35% for San Joaquin salmon to recover and achieve the state and federal salmon doubling goal.
 Diverting 65% of the Flow Won‚Äôt Restore California‚Äôs Magnificent Salmon
 Scientists and fishery managers with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the State Water Resources Control Board, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and The Bay Institute, as well as independent scientific peer reviews and other conservation and fishing groups, have recognized that current flows are inadequate. For instance, in 2010, the State Water Resources Control Board concluded that the best available science showed that 60% of the natural flows should remain in the river in the spring months in order to achieve the salmon doubling requirement of state law and protect public trust resources (this was a non-binding conclusion). The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has also concluded that much higher spring flows in these tributaries and the lower San Joaquin River are necessary to recover salmon and achieve the salmon doubling requirement. Allowing the diversion of 65% of the water from would increase diversions on the Stanislaus River and isn‚Äôt even enough to meet minimum requirements under the Endangered Species Act on the Stanislaus River; if these flows are lower than what‚Äôs needed to avoid potential extinction, they obviously will not lead to recovery and salmon doubling. And independent scientific peer reviews of the Board's technical report last year endorsed the scientific analysis showing that higher flows are necessary to recover salmon and recommended consideration of higher flows than 60%, which is the upper end of the range that the State Water Resources Control Board is considering.
 We Can Maintain Healthy Agricultural Economy and Healthy Rivers
 The Board‚Äôs draft analysis shows that reducing diversions to increase river flows will still result in a robust agricultural economy; for instance, the Board found that allowing 40% of the flow down the river would result in a 1.5% reduction in agricultural revenue in the region. And this is likely a worst case scenario, as the Board‚Äôs analysis ignores the potential to increase agricultural water use efficiency to allow farmers to grow ‚Äúmore crop per drop‚Äù and increase profits, as well as water transfers between farmers and downstream exporters that could potentially help fund these improvements.
 Increasing Flows in the River Benefits Lots of People, Too
 Improving flows and restoring salmon has huge benefits for salmon fishermen, tackle shops, charter boats, fishing guides, and the thousands of jobs that depend on a healthy salmon fishery. Improved flows would improve water quality for Delta farmers and for cities and farms that get water exported from the Delta, and it is critical to restoring the health of the Delta. Allowing 65% of the water to be diverted in the basin leaves only a third for the rest of us.
 Will California Restore the Health of the Low San Joaquin River and its Salmon?
 The science is clear that more flows are needed than 35%, but the State Board is under pressure to adopt these weaker flow requirements despite the strong scientific evidence. In the coming weeks, fishermen, farmers, conservation groups, boaters, birdwatchers, scientists, and all of us will have a chance to tell the State Water Resources Control Board to do better to help ensure the future of California‚Äôs salmon. We can and should do better than 35%: is a third of a river really healthy? I hope you‚Äôll join us in urging the Board to do better.

 Imagine you are a decision-maker at the State Water Resources Control Board in California. Given the scientific evidence and the various perspectives presented, write a letter to the board explaining what percentage of the natural flow you think should remain in the rivers (Merced, Tuolumne, and Stanislaus) to protect salmon and fisheries in the Lower San Joaquin River and its tributaries.
 
 In your letter, include at least three reasons to support your position and consider the perspectives of different stakeholders (e.g., farmers, fishermen, conservation groups).
 approx. 250-300 words

 ### ANSWER:
 Dear State Water Resources Control Board, I strongly believe that at least 60% of the natural flow should remain in the Merced, Tuolumne, and Stanislaus rivers to protect salmon and fisheries in the Lower San Joaquin River and its tributaries. Firstly, the scientific evidence presented by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and independent peer reviews clearly indicates that current flows are inadequate for salmon recovery. Secondly, reducing diversions to increase river flows will still result in a robust agricultural economy, with the Board's draft analysis showing only a 1.5% reduction in agricultural revenue in the region if 40% of the flow is allowed down the river. Additionally, improving flows and restoring salmon has huge benefits for salmon fishermen, tackle shops, charter boats, fishing guides, and the thousands of jobs that depend on a healthy salmon fishery. By prioritizing the health of our rivers and the communities that depend on them, we can ensure a sustainable future for California's salmon. Sincerely, [Your Name].",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Your letter effectively conveys a clear position on the percentage of natural flow that should remain in the rivers, and you provide some good reasons to support your stance. However, there are a couple of areas that need improvement.
 
 To strengthen your argument, consider including more specific data and statistics from the text, such as the percentage of natural flow that is currently diverted (65%) and the percentage that the State Water Resources Control Board is considering (35%). This will help to make your position more convincing and evidence-based.
 To address the perspectives of different stakeholders, you could consider adding a sentence or two to acknowledge the concerns of farmers and the potential impact on the agricultural economy. For example, you could mention that while reducing diversions may have some impact on agriculture, the benefits of improved river health and salmon recovery will ultimately outweigh the costs. This will help to demonstrate that you have considered multiple perspectives and are not just focused on one stakeholder group.","### FEEDBACK: 200 Words or Less
 
 Your response effectively highlights the need for increased river flows to protect salmon and fisheries, but there are areas where additional detail and balance could strengthen your argument:
 
 1. **Scientific Evidence**: While you mention the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and independent peer reviews, specify the exact findings or studies that support a 60% flow. Citing specific percentages or studies would add credibility.
 
 2. **Economic Impact**: You note a 1.5% reduction in agricultural revenue with 40% flow, but this figure is based on a 40% flow, not 60%. Clarify how a 60% flow might impact agriculture and discuss potential strategies like water-use efficiency to mitigate economic losses.
 
 3. **Stakeholder Perspectives**: Expand on how different stakeholders view a 60% flow. For example, what do conservation groups, fishermen, and farmers specifically say about this level? Including direct quotes or references would bolster your argument.
 
 4. **Flow Levels**: Clearly articulate why 60% is essential for salmon recovery and how it aligns with the goal of doubling salmon populations. Explain why 35% falls short according to scientific consensus.
 
 5. **Conclusion**: Reinforce your recommendation by summarizing the key points and emphasizing the importance of balancing environmental and economic needs for a sustainable future.
 
 Overall, your letter is concise and addresses key issues, but adding specific details and stakeholder viewpoints would make it more compelling and comprehensive.",A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Krishna (Sanskrit: ‡§ï‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§£) (k·πõ·π£·πáa in IAST, pronounced [ÀàkrÃ© Ç…≥…ô] literally ""dark, black"") is a central figure of Hinduism. He is known as the eighth and ""complete"" avatar of Lord Vishnu, come to restore Dharma to the earth in a time of great dharmic imbalance. Krishna is identified as a historical individual who participated in the events of the Mahabharata.
 Krishna is often described as an infant or young boy playing a flute as in the Bhagavata Purana, or as a youthful prince giving direction and guidance as in the Bhagavad Gita. The stories of Krishna appear across a broad spectrum of Hindu philosophical and theological traditions. They portray him in various perspectives: a god-child, a prankster, a model lover, a divine hero and the Supreme Being. The principal scriptures discussing Krishna's story are the Mahabharata, the Harivamsa, the Bhagavata Purana and the Vishnu Purana.
 Worship of a deity of Krishna, in the form of Vasudeva, Bala Krishna or Gopala, can be traced to as early as 4th century BC. Worship of Krishna as svayam bhagavan, or the Supreme Being, known as Krishnaism, arose in the Middle Ages in the context of the bhakti movement. From the 10th century AD, Krishna became a favorite subject in performing arts and regional traditions of devotion developed for forms of Krishna such as Jagannatha in Orissa, Vithoba in Maharashtra and Shrinathji in Rajasthan. Since the 1960s the worship of Krishna has also spread in the West, largely due to the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

 So last week we were pelted with a terrible snow/ice storm the night before a physics test. Little did any of us know that it would put us out of school for four days (6 days when you count the weekend). As the students came back on Monday there was no way I expected them to be ready for their test. We both needed a few days to get back into the swing of things.
 Enter mind mapping‚Ä¶
 Both of my classes (regulars and honors physics) ate it up. I pitched them the idea (like a good salesman‚Ä¶ I mean teacher has to do) and they got to work on mapping out their unit. Some drew creative pictures, some used circles, some squares, some even used different colors to help organize their materials. It was beautiful. I then broke them into groups of 2 or 3 and had them compare their mind maps. I encouraged them to check for accuracy, borrow things they liked from other maps, and continue to develop their review maps. We discussed visual learning and how some students are wired to be more visual. We tied it into our future education and how this is especially useful with larger amounts of material (college exams, finals). Not only did we get all of that from the 25 min activity, but they also reviewed their test material.
 So was is mind mapping???
 Mind mapping is a visual organization of material. It is taking notes in a graphical manner (per the Wikipedia article). It‚Äôs basically what I‚Äôve always done on my napkin at my favorite coffee shop, but now I know the formal name. I never used this while I was growing up in school but had I known about it I would have used it all the time. The way I think about it is mind mapping takes all the papers on my constantly messy desk (different yet connected ideas) and places them neatly in the filing cabinet (some portion of my brain for storage and recall).
 A quick google image search will provide you with a ton of examples.

 ### ANSWER:
 A sample mind map for a math test study skill can be created with a central bubble labeled 'Math Test' branching into 3 main topics: 'Equations', 'Formulas', and 'Problem-Solving Strategies.'",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: 200 Words or Less
 
 Your mind map structure is clear and well-organized, starting with the central topic ""Math Test"" and branching into three main areas: Equations, Formulas, and Problem-Solving Strategies. However, consider adding more detail within each branch to enhance its usefulness as a study tool. For example, under ""Equations,"" you could list specific types like linear, quadratic, or trigonometric equations, and include examples of each.
 
 Using different colors, shapes, and symbols would make the map more engaging and easier to navigate. For instance, use circles for equations, triangles for formulas, and stars for strategies. This visual distinction can aid in quicker recall during study sessions.
 
 Here are three specific examples of how your mind map can be used:
 1. **Review Sessions:** Use the map to guide review sessions, focusing on one area at a time.
 2. **Practice Problems:** Identify key formulas and equations to practice solving problems related to those topics.
 3. **Concept Connections:** Visualize how different problem-solving strategies apply to various types of equations and formulas.
 
 The benefits of using mind maps include improved retention through visual organization and enhanced understanding by connecting related concepts. They cater to visual learners and help in breaking down complex information into manageable parts.
 
 Encourage further development by including more details and visual aids to maximize the map's effectiveness as a study tool.","### FEEDBACK: A good start on creating a mind map for a math test study skill, but there are a few areas that need improvement.
 
 To make the mind map more effective, consider adding more specific examples of equations, formulas, and problem-solving strategies. For instance, under 'Equations,' you could include 'Linear Equations,' 'Quadratic Equations,' and 'Systems of Equations.' Under 'Formulas,' you could include 'Area of a Circle,' 'Volume of a Cylinder,' and 'Pythagorean Theorem.' Under 'Problem-Solving Strategies,' you could include 'Draw a Diagram,' 'Work Backwards,' and 'Use a Table.'
 To better explain the benefits of using mind maps as a study tool, consider adding more details about how mind maps can help with visual learning. For example, you could mention how mind maps can help students see the relationships between different concepts, make connections between ideas, and improve their memory retention. Additionally, you could explain how mind maps can help students identify areas where they need more practice or review.",B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 VIRUS DISEASES OF ALLIUM SPECIES AND PROSPECTS FOR THEIR CONTROL
 The potyviruses are the most important because they induce yellow striping which may result in large yield reductions. Their transmission takes place efficiently by various aphid species when briefly probing on plants. These viruses and their host-specific strains are usually limited to a single Allium species. Onion yellow dwarf virus (OYDV) is known from onion (A. cepa) and shallot (A. cepa var. ascalonicum) in the USA and Europe. Shallot crops in Asia were found to be infested by the new shallot yellow stripe virus (SYSV). Work at the Lembang Horticultural Research Institute in Lembang, Indonesia, showed that OYDV is now spreading in Java. Leek yellow stripe virus (LYSV) occurs in leek (A. ampeloprasum var. porrum) in Europe and in pearl onion (A. ampeloprasum var. sectivum) in Indonesia. Garlic strains of OYDV (OYDV-G) and of LYSV (LYSV-G) affect garlic (A. sativum) worldwide. Striping in Welsh onion (A. fistulosum) is due to the new Welsh onion yellow stripe virus (WoYSV), which probably also causes the virus disease reported in Japan in rakkyo (A. chinense).
 Control of OYDV in shallot crops and of OYDV-G in garlic crops in some European countries is by strict certification of bulbs for planting, but this is expensive and requires a well-functioning inspection service. Shallot and garlic crops in other countries often contain some plants not infected by potyvirus or not showing symptoms of potyvirus infection. Such plants may carry genetic resistance or may be cross-protected by a mild virus strain. Propagation and distribution of planting stock from healthy plants selected in the field or obtained by resistance breeding seem promising for improving yields of vegetatively propagated allium crops in the tropics. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Assess the potential effectiveness of using cross-protection by a mild virus strain to control the spread of potyviruses in Allium species
 
 Explain the cross-protection mechanism and how it can be applied to control potyviruses in Allium crops
 Discuss the advantages and limitations of cross-protection compared to other control methods such as strict certification of bulbs for planting and resistance breeding
 Propose a research plan to investigate the feasibility of using cross-protection to control potyviruses in a specific Allium species such as onion or garlic
 Consider the potential economic and environmental impacts of implementing cross-protection as a control method for potyviruses in Allium crops
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 Cross-protection by a mild virus strain can be an effective method to control the spread of potyviruses in Allium species, as it can provide genetic resistance to the crop and reduce the severity of symptoms. This method involves infecting the crop with a mild strain of the virus, which triggers a defense response that protects the plant against infection by more severe strains. To apply cross-protection, farmers can propagate and distribute planting stock from healthy plants selected in the field or obtained by resistance breeding. Cross-protection has several advantages, including being a cost-effective and environmentally friendly method, as it reduces the need for pesticides and other chemicals. However, it also has some limitations, such as the risk of the mild strain mutating into a more severe strain, and the potential for the protected plants to still transmit the virus to other plants. A research plan to investigate the feasibility of using cross-protection to control potyviruses in onion or garlic could involve conducting field trials to assess the effectiveness of cross-protection in reducing the severity of symptoms and improving yields, as well as conducting laboratory tests to identify the most effective mild virus strains for use in cross-protection. Implementing cross-protection as a control method for potyviruses in Allium crops could have significant economic and environmental impacts, including reducing the economic losses associated with potyvirus infections and decreasing the environmental impact of pesticide use.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: 200 WORDS OR LESS
 
 Your explanation of cross-protection as a method to control potyviruses in Allium species is clear and concise. However, there are a few areas where additional detail would enhance the response:
 
 1. **Mechanism of Cross-Protection**: While you mentioned that cross-protection involves infecting the crop with a mild virus strain to trigger a defense response, you could elaborate further on the underlying biological mechanisms. For example, discuss how the mild strain induces systemic acquired resistance (SAR) or localized acquired resistance (LAR).
 
 2. **Comparison to Other Methods**: You noted the advantages and limitations of cross-protection compared to strict certification and resistance breeding. However, you didn't fully explore these comparisons. Consider adding specific details about the costs, practicality, and long-term sustainability of each method.
 
 3. **Research Plan**: Your proposed research plan is a good start, but it lacks specificity. For instance, specify what types of field trials and laboratory tests would be conducted. Also, mention the criteria for selecting the mild virus strains and how their effectiveness will be measured.
 
 4. **Economic and Environmental Impacts**: While you touched on economic and environmental benefits, you could provide more concrete examples or scenarios. For instance, quantify potential savings in terms of reduced pesticide use and increased yield.
 
 Here‚Äôs a revised version incorporating these points:
 
 **Cross-protection by a mild virus strain can be an effective method to control potyviruses in Allium species. It works by infecting crops with a mild strain, triggering systemic acquired resistance (SAR) or localized acquired resistance (LAR), which protects plants against more severe strains. Advantages include cost-effectiveness and reduced chemical use, but limitations include mutation risks and continued virus transmission. Compared to strict certification (expensive, requiring robust inspection services) and resistance breeding (time-consuming), cross-protection offers a balanced approach. A research plan could involve field trials assessing symptom reduction and yield improvement, along with lab tests identifying optimal mild strains. Economic impacts might include reduced pesticide costs and higher yields, while environmental benefits could stem from decreased chemical use.**
 
 This revision provides a more comprehensive overview and addresses the key aspects of the assignment effectively.","### FEEDBACK: Your response provides a good overview of the potential effectiveness of using cross-protection by a mild virus strain to control the spread of potyviruses in Allium species. However, there are a few areas that need improvement.
 
 You mentioned that cross-protection can provide genetic resistance to the crop, but this is not entirely accurate. Cross-protection is a temporary measure that provides protection against severe strains of the virus, but it does not provide genetic resistance to the crop. The crop remains susceptible to the virus, but the mild strain triggers a defense response that protects the plant against infection by more severe strains.

 What causes morning sickness in pregnancy?
 As many pregnant women know, the bouts of nausea and vomiting that are commonly called ""morning sickness"" can happen any time of day. An estimated 60 to 80 percent of women experience this symptom of early pregnancy, which may be caused by hormonal changes and can be aggravated by stress or fatigue. For most women, the nausea and vomiting fade by the 17th week of pregnancy. In rare cases, a pregnant woman will experience morning sickness well past this point. Even more rare is hyperemesis gravidarum, a very severe form of morning sickness that prevents a pregnant woman from keeping in the fluids or nutrition she needs. This condition requires medical treatment. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

 One of the most common childhood fears is the fear of the dark. However, being scared of the dark is not so exclusive to children anymore. In fact, a new study presented at the Associated Professional Sleep Societies annual meeting suggests for the first time that an underlying fear of the dark might be one of the causes of insomnia. Insomniacs or those with sleeping problems might want to pay attention to this sleep study. If you can‚Äôt fall asleep without a nightlight, you might want to pay attention to this potential discovery of a new form of insomnia treatment.
 What is Insomnia?
 Put simply, insomnia is the inability to sleep. There is acute, or short-term, insomnia and chronic, or long-term, insomnia. Acute insomnia may be caused by something situational, like stress at work or financially. Chronic insomnia lasts for over a month, and is often indicative of another problem. If you think you may suffer of insomnia or have before, don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôre not alone. Actually, victims of insomnia are the majority. More than 50 percent of Americans have reported having sleeping problems in the past year. There are medicines you can take for insomnia, but clearly, there‚Äôs still some problems to work on for those with sleep trouble.
 New Study on Insomnia and Darkness
 In this new sleep study, the Associated Professional Sleep Societies gathered 93 individuals, both good sleepers and bad, with an average age of 22 and with 73 percent of them being women. A survey they took of the participants showed that 46 percent of the bad sleepers said they had some fears of the dark, as opposed to the 26 percent of good sleepers. They tested this survey with a study using eye-blink latency, and what they found only confirmed what was reported in the survey.
 Does Darkness Cause Insomnia?Poor sleepers experienced a decrease in eyeblink latency when exposed to noise and good sleepers experienced an increase. What that means the noises startled the poor sleepers than the good sleepers, and the good sleepers were better able to accommodate to the noises. Researchers figured this out by monitoring small twitches in the eye muscles, and the bumps in the night startled the poor sleepers much more. This goes to show that those who have to sleep with the TV on or with the bathroom light on and have trouble sleeping may be able to put two and two together. Their fear of the dark could be leading to their insomnia.
 How to Sleep Better: There's Hope for Insomniacs!
 In the past, insomnia has often been fought with the use of drugs and home remedies. For some, this has worked, but others still suffer from sleep deprevation. This may offer the simple treatment of a phobia, which will in turn cure their insomnia. This non-drug therapy may prove to be a major achievement in those looking for help with their sleeping problems.
 46 percent of poor sleepers who are afraid of the dark is not a small number, and could be a big leap in sleep studies. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

 ### ANSWER:
 I chose the space shuttle. The space shuttle has a reusable orbiter with three main components. The first component is a reusable orbiter, made of aluminum alloys to reduce weight and increase strength. The second component is the external fuel tank, made of foam-covered steel for increased stiffness and uniqueness. The final component is the solid rocket booster, made of steel to carry the thrust forces. To modify the space shuttle for a trip to Mars, I propose lengthening the external fuel tank and increasing the thrust by 50. This will allow the rocket to fly higher and longer and give the increased interplanetary travel uniqueness.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Design a Rocket Structure
 
 **Conceptual Clarity:**
 Your description of the Space Shuttle's components is mostly accurate, but there are a few corrections and improvements needed:
 - **Reusable Orbiter:** Correctly identified as being made of aluminum alloys for strength and weight reduction.
 - **External Fuel Tank:** The tank is actually made of aluminum, not steel, and covered with foam insulation to protect it from thermal stress. Foam is not a structural material but serves to insulate the cryogenic fuels inside.
 - **Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs):** These are indeed made of steel, but they are not just for carrying thrust forces; they provide significant lift during the initial stages of the launch.
 
 **Proposed Modifications:**
 - **Lengthening External Tank:** Increasing the size of the external tank can extend the duration of the flight, but consider specifying the exact dimensions and how this impacts fuel capacity and overall mass.
 - **Thrust Increase:** Instead of a vague ""increase by 50,"" specify the exact thrust level and how it affects performance. For Mars missions, a more efficient propulsion system might be preferable, such as advanced chemical engines or even nuclear thermal propulsion.
 
 **Enhancements:**
 - **Payload Capacity:** For Mars missions, consider adding habitat modules or scientific instruments. Specify what these additions are and their benefits.
 - **Structural Changes:** Think about incorporating new materials like carbon composites for lighter yet stronger structures. Explain how these materials improve the mission.

 The first part introduces Pi and his interests. We learn from this section that Pi is interested in zoology and religion. Pi attempts to combine the three religions together and is confronted by the imam, pandit, and priest. His parents eventually relent thinking that this is just a phase for him.
 Part Two is the part where the boat sinks and Pi is stranded on a lifeboat with a tiger, an orangautan, a hyena, and an injured zebra. The hyena devours the zebra and orangautan, and later the hyena itself is killed by the tiger. Pi has to find a way to appease himself and the tiger. He later meets a blind Frenchmen, who tries to take advantage of Pi. Unfortunately, he steps into Richard Parker's (the tiger) territory and is killed.
 In Part Three, two agents from Japan are investigating the matter and come to Tomatlan, Mexico, where Pi was washed ashore. They find his story hard to believe as they continue questioning him. They write a report at the end that concludes that the ship sank because of internal problems, concluding using only Pi's description, because all the evidence is now at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.

 Your analysis of Part Two in *Life of Pi* is strong, focusing on the theme of survival and adaptability. Here‚Äôs how you can refine and expand it:
 
 - **Survival and Adaptability**: You correctly highlight Pi's struggle to coexist with Richard Parker. To strengthen this, consider including more specific interactions between Pi and the tiger, such as Pi's method of feeding the tiger from a distance to avoid confrontation. Also, discuss Pi's development of strategies like floating on a makeshift raft to keep safe from the tiger.
 
 - **Hope and Resilience**: While you touched on hope and resilience, providing more textual evidence would enhance your argument. For example, Pi‚Äôs nightly prayers and his creation of a daily routine on the lifeboat illustrate his determination to hold onto hope despite dire circumstances.
 
 - **Textual Evidence**: Ensure you cite specific quotes to support your points. For instance, use Pi‚Äôs reflections on the nature of hope and his belief in the power of storytelling to maintain his sanity.
 
 - **Redundant Information**: Remove the unrelated comment about Passenger pigeons, as it doesn‚Äôt contribute to your argument about Part Two.

 Poem writing requires talent and inspiration. True poets can easily find the necessary words and rhymes for expressing their inner state. People who are not experienced in this activity cannot do it quickly and easily. In fact, it does not matter what level you are at the moment. Writing poems is a skill that can and must be developed. A novice poet needs to know that there are certain criteria for evaluating poetry works. First of all, there must be a new idea, a thought expressed in a poetic form. Second, it is necessary to determine the balance of form and content and strictly observe it in the poetic work. In any language, there are rules that must be adhered to, especially for novice authors. A young poet may not master the language, but the clarity of presentation and literacy is the minimum that a beginner must possess for the reader to understand him or her.
 How to Start a Poem Creation
 Anyone can learn how to write poetry. First and foremost, if you want to learn how to do it, you should hone not only your writing skills. Any grammatical inaccuracy in poetry is much more remarkable than in prose. How can you improve your literacy? There is a very simple way; you need to read well-written books. The daily reading of poetry will become a powerful impulse for you and your creativity. This is a very important stage. You will feel how after reading your favorite works you begin to speak poetry. Try to alternate classics and contemporary authors. Being acquainted with different styles and forms will increase your writing skills.
 Life Experience and Poems
 Do not be afraid to be sincere in your poems. Lyrical poems are usually devoted to close people, nature, different memories, etc. In order to understand the importance of human heat, to see the nuances of nature‚Äôs beauty, you need to have great life experience. Lyrical poetry is most often created by writers at a young age.
 Philosophy can be represented in poetry only as a kind of creativity of the authors who have passed a certain age boundary. Philosophy is not an area of energetic boys and young girls, but an area of elders who are taught by their lives.
 Tips for Writing a Poem
 To become a good poet, you need to know a few more things that are important. Not all people have talent, and not every writer can become a genius. However, each person can learn how to create interesting and non-trivial verses.
 The first thing you need to know about poetry is its basic elements, namely, rhyme and rhythm. These features make it possible to distinguish poetry from prose. There are many different kinds of rhymes. You can easily find their examples on the Internet. You need to practice creating different combinations of words constantly until you can write them easily and quickly.
 The use of this or that rhyme should be meaningful, do not use too trivial rhymes. The main principle of any creativity is its novelty. That is why this kind of activity is called creativity, i.e., creating something new and not copying other people‚Äôs ideas.
 Look for Interesting Images
 The main task of the author is to tell about simple things in interesting words. Learn to express your thoughts through images. Look for inspiration. For example, pay attention to the nature around you. However, be careful; do not try to use the metaphors of famous poets in your works.
 More poems are devoted to one theme, love. Of course, there are real masterpieces among them. However, not many novice writers will be able to create something similar to the works of Shakespeare. Try to show your originality. Look for new, non-trivial topics from social life and philosophy.
 Think of the Plot
 If you write a small poem, the presence of a clear plot is not necessary. However, if you are mulling over creating a large work (for example, a novel in verse), you need to find an interesting and exciting plot. It is also necessary to remember how important the structure of the text is. Use different literary techniques to make your poem attractive to readers. For example, you can present the events of your novel in the form of a retrospective and use interesting metaphors, etc.
 Do not Write Poetry for the Sake of Glory
 Many writers were unknown during their lifetime and did not count on world fame, so you also do not need to hope that your first poem will be recognized as a genius masterpiece. Do not force yourself to write something; you must feel inspiration. It may appear unexpectedly, but at the same time, you can create such an atmosphere that can increase the chances of inspiration awakening. Walk, visit interesting places, travel around the world.
 In order to become a good author, you need to practice. However, this does not mean that you need to publish or show your every work. Do not be graphomaniac. Today many young people consider themselves to be successful poets and publish several similar and uninteresting works per day in their blogs. Many classics of literature waited for inspiration for years to create masterpieces, remember this.
 Do not Be Afraid to Change the Structure of the Poem
 Very often, poets are faced with a problem when it is very difficult to find a suitable word. In this case, it is worthwhile to think about changing the structure of the entire poem. Creating a good work can take a long time. Do not be afraid to experiment and try different options. If you find it hard to concentrate on a thought, you need to rest. Read your poem the next day; perhaps a fresh mind will help you discover inaccuracies and errors that you have not noticed before. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

 Your response provides a solid framework for developing a nuanced portfolio piece on lyrical poetry. Here are some specific points for improvement:
 
 1. **Thesis Statement**: While you've identified a topic (climate change), a clearer, more concise thesis statement is needed. For example: ""This poem explores the urgent call for environmental action through the lens of climate change, highlighting the poet's voice and the impact of vivid imagery.""
 
 2. **Poem Composition**: You haven't provided the actual 12-line poem with a consistent rhyme scheme and vivid imagery. Ensure your poem includes sensory details and metaphors. For instance, you could describe melting ice caps as ""tears of a frozen earth"" or compare rising sea levels to ""a relentless tide swallowing homes.""
 
 3. **Structural Form and Techniques**: Experiment with different forms like retrospective narration or varied line lengths to enhance the poem's impact. Consider using enjambment to create a sense of continuity or caesura for dramatic pauses.
 
 4. **Revisions and Refinements**: After drafting, revise your poem to ensure it adheres to a consistent rhyme scheme and effectively conveys your central idea. Reading it aloud can help identify areas needing refinement.
 
 By addressing these points, your piece will better showcase the interplay between the poet's voice, structural form, and themes, making it a compelling and nuanced exploration of lyrical poetry.

 And Seaburg adds, ""If you have a chronic illness or take prescription medications and you are evacuated or choose to go to a community center, make someone aware that you have a medical condition, so they will know what to check for if your behavior seems a little unusual.""
 Another consideration during a loss of power is for patients with chronic breathing problems.
 People who require continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, devices for sleep apnea or other sleep issues will need an alternative source of power. There are options available for most machines, including CPAP battery packs, DC power options, marine battery adapters and travel-specific CPAP machines to provide power in the event of an electrical outage.
 Keeping food at a healthy temperature may be a challenge during a power loss.
 Refrigerators keep dairy products, meat, fish, poultry and eggs at a healthy temperature if they are 40 degrees Fahrenheit or below, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. If your power goes out, your refrigerator will stay at the proper temperature for about four hours if it's unopened. Placing ice bags or dry ice will help to maintain healthy cooling.
 A full freezer will remain cool for about 48 hours, or for about 24 hours if half full. It's a good idea to have digital thermometers on hand to check the temperature.
 Once the thermometer goes above the recommended temperature, avoid eating any dairy products, meat, fish, poultry or eggs. Throw away items that have been compromised.
 The USDA suggests keeping a supply of canned and packaged foods that do not require refrigeration. Coolers are a good solution if your power will be on within 24 hours. And knowing where to purchase ice and dry ice is a good way to plan for an emergency. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

 Living in space should be an amazing challenge, but however practical and (relatively) easy to create will be spaceships and habitats, there is nothing above a genuine planet to live on. Besides, it‚Äôs much safer during those galactic wars than fragile space bases, where a single hit can leave you grasping for air‚Ä¶ or maybe not, considering planets cannot escape. But I digress.
 If we ever rise into space, and find planets close enough to ours, then, no doubt, our kind will seek to change them to our own image, and make them habitable.
 This is a collection of ideas around the concept of terraforming. Which of them are likely to be used will depend on the level of technology, and too many other factors.
 Additional thoughts are welcome. Please try to keep the format (major themes as scroll comments, lesser topics as replies).
 And sorry for the broken outside links. :|
 Additional Ideas (10)
 Whenever the requirement of stability is mentioned, you should also consider the proper timescale, as compared to the human lifespan. Geological and astronomical phenomena can take LONG. If a planet becomes uninhabitable after ten thousands years, it is perfectly fine for settling down now! Even centuries may be okay.
 Changing the kinetic properties of a planet is not an easy task, though more a question of raw power than of intricate knowledge. A typical method would be bombarding it with directed comets and asteroids, giving it little pushes at the right moments (and handily depositing organic substances, incidentally heating up the atmosphere a little).
 But this is not only a matter of how long you prefer your day, or year to be! Distant planets receive less sunlight, closer ones more; a too distorted elliptic orbit may cause extreme shifts in temperatures over the year, and require intervention. Day and night mean variations as well, so they need to be balanced similarly.
 Checking rare constellations is not always astrology.
 For planet-based life, an atmosphere is a most handy place to deposit the waste, and find basic nourishment. As everything diffuses in it fast, basically any lifeform from the surface can be expected to interact with the atmosphere to some degree. It is therefore of key importance to have this part covered.
 Small planets may have none to speak of, so a weak adaptation would be to make an atmosphere that is sufficient to allow people to carry masks instead of vacuum suit. A breathable air, though, is something different. If lacking the gravity to hold its air, some parts or all parts may over time ""evaporate"" into space. Especially hydrogen is susceptible here, this is suspected to what happened to Mars - water would decompose in the upper layers of atmosphere, the hydrogen leaving, oxygen staying to be eventually bound to other chemicals.
 Still, small planets may be designed with this risk taken into account, renewing the composition of gases regularly. (Consider stability.)
 - as a flavour element, a different atmosphere may indeed taste differently. It may also have a different color (that depends on the sun(s) as well).
 - even little differences count sometimes; imagine diseases spreading well on some worlds while little on others; or aliens attacking a given human-colonized planet for no apparent reason, as they happen to like a certain type of air.
 The ability of human lungs to extract oxygen from the air is dependent on a concept called 'partial pressure'. Partial pressure is the amount of total pressure dependent on one given component of the atmosphere. Humans require about 3 pounds per square inch of oxygen, and an atmosphere of less than 0.02 psi Carbon dioxide. The balance can be composed of nearly any substantially inert gas. Explorers and terraformers must display some caution however, as high partial pressures of inert gas may cause a kind of intoxication, known as nitrogen narcosis. Excessive oxygen (>7psi partial), meanwhile, is a powerful poison.
 To a large part, the temperature of astronomical bodies considered here will be determined by the activity of their sun - and what happens with the radiation on/around the planet itself.
 An important term is Albedo, the reflective ratio of electromagnetic radiation power; simply put, white surface reflects light (high albedo), while dark surface absorbs it (low). For our purposes, we can extend this beyond the visible parts of the spectrum.
 The albedo of a planet can be influenced by the atmosphere itself (and the clouds). And these three in turn can be influenced by the biosphere once it has sufficient impact - so select the initial flora carefully, to avoid complications.
 But let's reconsider this from the main point of view: Life, as we are used to it, requires a thin range of temperatures to prosper in. Life in general can be expected to be much more robust.
 The frictional heating of a moon's interior due to flexure caused by the gravitational pull of its parent planet and possibly neighboring satellites. The most dramatic example in the Sol system is the tidal heating induced in each of the four Galilean satellites by their mutual pull and, more significantly, by the powerful attraction of Jupiter. In the case of Io, the result is global volcanism. In the case of Europa, and perhaps also of Ganymede and Callisto, the effects of tidal heating are less dramatic but possibly much more profound in that they give rise to a suspected under-ice ocean which might conceivably support life.
 For a comfortable living, the surface should be mostly stable, as intense tectonic activity can spoil anyone's day. From the initial and unstable periods of a planet's existence, this activity can be expected to lessen over time, as a homogeneous body forms and the internal heat with radiation cool down. (Moons) and other interstellar bodies disrupt this tendency towards piece.
 According to some theories, tectonic plates we know on Earth are caused by life as well. The slow, but relentless processing and transporting of some materials, and the frugal deposition of others (a classical example are corals), keep exerting pressure on parts of the Earth's crust. Given enough time on the (geological scale), this may drive the tectonics of a whole world.
 This doesn't even start on the topic of surface itself, ie geography. There can be 'young' worlds with many extremes, and strongly eroded 'old' worlds. There can be worlds mostly covered by oceans, or purely desert worlds. Anything is possible.
 Particularly moons and smaller planets don't have the 1G we are used to (future sensitivities in this regard may vary, of course). A way to imbue these bodies with larger gravity is to shrink them (see http://crowlspace.com/?p=70). With strong gravitational/electromagnetic/something fields could be a planet compressed to higher density, and the same weight with a smaller radius has just the required result.
 How this process would exactly work, and what difficulties it would bring, I leave to the reader's imagination.
 Credit goes to crowlspace.com
 While all of this is hypothetical, the role of our own moon is to many scientists vital, if not critical for our environment. On the one side, it probably helps keeping the core of Earth in rotation, thus enabling a strong magnetic field which is also deemed important. On the other hand, there is the immeasurable impact on our oceans.
 Note that our moon is relatively large when compared to our planet. The effect of a smaller moon or several is likely to be different.
 Life, when in sufficient amount, will influence or dominate a planet's weather, and determine things like temperature, humidity and surface composition. Where such a complex system will evolve may be hard to tell - it may very well grow beyond the plans of its creators, and beyond their control, though not necessarily to the detriment of life in general.
 The same is true for the composition of the atmosphere, so care should be taken to pick the right fauna and flora, and if needed change it to achieve the necessary dynamic stability.
 The proper science for the study of these effects may be geophysiology, more popularly known as the Gaia theory. Life, it claims, has a tendency to support itself.
 So what happens if new, transplanted life starts to prosper, and meets the older, local lifeform suddenly thriving in the changed environment?
 - life - where applicable, organisms, probably genetically engineered or altered, will tackle on the task of converting the geosphere into a biosphere, see also Ecopoiesis.
 Although effective, and good at creating an initial store of organic compounds for the later, more advanced biosphere, this can take VERY LONG, picture hundreds or thousands of years. Races with a sufficient lifespan or foresight may seed this way numerous planets for later use - and be quite annoyed when they come to their new home only to see it was 'discovered' by somebody else!
 Even if other methods are used, it is useful to start planting useful plants as a planet becomes more and more habitable. Making the planet alive will take time.
 - chemistry - making the problem one of the right catalysts, all is needed is a massive reactor to supply energy, and the time for the brute-force approach to get the job done.
 - nanotechnologies - a potentially very viable option, to let tiny machines do the work for you. This may be easy, but watch for the chance of their 'mutation', or getting out of control like with the lifeforms. (Most likely they will have to multiply on their own to cover a whole planet, so tiny flaws could be replicated...) It is suggested to make them of limited duration to naturally pass away once their purpose is fulfilled.
 The Firefly setting, as cool as it is, rests on one very unrealistic assumption: dozens of planets and moons fitting for life exist in a single solar system. But for the sake of storytelling, we can't let ourselves limit with something that is merely 'improbable', can we?
 By the way, most stars appear to be members of double star or triple star, or even double-double star systems.
 A theoretical alternative to have more planets in a good location, is to have several on one orbit. (See the Klemperer rosettes for more info.)
 Both of the above cases should be rare. While they are thought to be quite stable, a question is if they can arise naturally, during the formation of a solar system.
 Their presence, therefore, may indicate a massive astrophysical intervention of an advanced civilization. So, ideal as they may be for settling, be careful around them.
 Per the setting material in the games and the novels, all these planets were terraformed by the Central Worlds not that long ago (by means not explained). They then litterally threw people at these worlds to syphon off excess population.
 One source is the Worlds and Planets scroll, some examples will follow.
 These planets may have the size, and even atmosphere, but they are not orbiting any sun, in fact they are not gravitationally bound to any star, and move through space on their own. Without a sun to warm them up, they are likely to be dead, frozen places. However, there are theories how even such a dark world could maintain and keep relatively high temperatures, high enough for life as we know it.
 (See the Wikipedia entry for more information.)
 - A Black Dwarf (a very hypotetical body) would be cold enough, but probably would have to loose on weight to be habitably.
 - Losing weight is easy also for other bodies (like brown dwarfs, large objects too cold to be stars), if there is something sufficiently large nearby - like, say, another star. Stripped of the outer layers, what remains could be a planet, of possibly quite an exotic mix. (Don't ask me how to terraform that, though. ;) ) \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

 Your answer identifies two promising methods for terraforming the planet's atmosphere: introducing microorganisms and using nanotechnology. Here are some refinements and additional considerations:
 
 1. **Introducing Microorganisms**:
  - **Advantages**: Microorganisms can naturally produce oxygen and remove harmful gases, mimicking Earth's early biosphere.
  - **Disadvantages**: This process is slow and requires a stable environment for the organisms to thrive.
  - **Risks**: Unintended mutations or interactions with native life forms could lead to unforeseen consequences. Additionally, ensuring the correct partial pressure of gases (e.g., oxygen and carbon dioxide) is crucial to prevent issues like nitrogen narcosis or excessive oxygen poisoning.
 
 2. **Nanotechnology**:
  - **Advantages**: Nanomachines can be programmed to perform specific tasks efficiently, like breaking down harmful gases or building up beneficial ones.
  - **Disadvantages**: There's a significant risk of the nanomachines replicating uncontrollably, leading to ecological disasters. Also, maintaining control over their functions is challenging.
  - **Risks**: Ensuring the longevity and containment of these machines is critical. They might mutate or spread beyond intended areas, causing environmental damage.
 
 Additionally, consider the planet's albedo and how changes in the atmosphere might affect surface temperatures. Reflective surfaces (high albedo) can help regulate temperatures, whereas darker surfaces (low albedo) absorb more heat. Introducing flora early can help stabilize these conditions over time.
 
 Encourage further exploration of how these methods could be integrated and monitored to ensure safety and effectiveness.","### FEEDBACK: The two potential methods scientists could use to terraform the planet's atmosphere are: 1) introducing microorganisms that can alter the atmospheric composition, and 2) using nanotechnology to break down or build up gases.

The second method involves using nanotechnology to break down or build up gases, such as using nanobots to remove excess carbon dioxide or add oxygen to the atmosphere. The advantages of the first method include its potential to create a stable and self-sustaining atmosphere, while the second method offers more precision and control over the atmospheric composition. However, the first method may take longer to produce results and may be more susceptible to unforeseen consequences, such as the microorganisms altering the atmosphere in unintended ways. The second method, on the other hand, may be more expensive and may require more advanced technology. Additionally, both methods carry the risk of unintended consequences, such as the microorganisms or nanobots altering the atmosphere in ways that are harmful to human life or the planet's ecosystem. Furthermore, the scientists must consider the partial pressure of the gases, the albedo of the planet, and the impact of the biosphere on the planet's environment to ensure a stable and habitable atmosphere.

 Shopping in credit city
 Students complete a shopping game to see how much money they would spend on four major purchases that require borrowing money.
 Borrowing money instead of paying cash for items can increase the total amount paid.
 How can you plan ahead when you need or want to make a large purchase?
 How can borrowing money to pay for items increase the total amount you spend?
 Calculate the total cost of items using an oversimplified interest formula
 Reflect on how borrowing affects the way you feel about purchases
 What students will do
 Roll a die to determine purchase price, interest rate, and length of loan needed to pay for four big-ticket items.
 Analyze how purchases made with a credit card may result in increased total cost of ownership when compared with paying with cash.
 Reflect on the experience of purchasing with cash versus credit. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Create a personal budget plan for a hypothetical purchase of a $10,000 car using a 5-year credit loan with a 6% annual interest rate.
 
 Calculate the total interest paid over the 5-year period using the simple interest formula I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the annual interest rate, and T is the time in years.
 Compare the total cost of the car (including interest) to the cash price and write a short reflection (approx. 100 words) on how borrowing money affects your feelings about the purchase.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 I = $10,000 * 6% * 5 years = $10,000 * 0.06 * 5 = $3,000, Total Cost = $10,000 + $3,000 = $13,000.

You should have added the interest to the principal amount to get the total cost. Additionally, your reflection is a good start, but it could be more detailed and specific.
 
 The total cost of the car should be $10,000 (principal) + $3,000 (interest) = $13,000, but you should have also considered the monthly payments and how they affect your budget.
 In your reflection, try to be more specific about how borrowing money affects your feelings about the purchase. For example, you could describe how the monthly payments might impact your ability to save for other expenses or how the total cost might make you feel more or less committed to the purchase.","### FEEDBACK: 200 Words or Less
 
 Your calculation is correct: the total interest paid over five years is $3,000, making the total cost of the car $13,000. However, it's important to note that the simple interest formula is an oversimplification. In reality, most loans use compound interest, which would increase the total cost further.
 
 Your reflection touches on the emotional impact of borrowing, but consider expanding it to include how the additional cost might affect your financial planning and future spending habits. For example, how might this extra expense influence your decision-making regarding other purchases or savings goals?
 
 To enhance your analysis, think about the benefits and drawbacks of using credit. Does having the car now outweigh the long-term financial burden? How does this compare to saving up and buying the car outright? Reflecting on these aspects can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs involved.
 
 Overall, your work demonstrates a good grasp of the basic concept. Expanding your reflection could offer deeper insights into the implications of borrowing for large purchases.",A,"Model A: I havent checked for accuracy of the calculation, but otherwise the ebst.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 (1 of 8 in a series)
 One of the best ways to understand what changed between the Old and New Testaments, between the Old and New Covenants, is to explore, study, and evaluate what exactly Jesus did when He ushered in the kingdom of God. We often comprehend the meaning of Jesus‚Äô first advent totally around His substitutionary death on the cross. But we cannot separate Jesus‚Äô delivery of a new covenant, a new arrangement with God that was made true by His death and resurrection from His broad description of initiating the kingdom of God on earth. The two are inseparable. When we accept the new arrangement with God that Jesus wrought on the cross as our substitute, when we embrace the gospel message of Jesus Christ, we become citizens of His kingdom immediately in the here and now.
 Jesus began His earthly ministry with this proclamation, ‚ÄúThe time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.‚Äù (Mk 1:15). That Jesus announced the kingdom of God has arrived should be of no surprise to us looking back since we believe that Jesus is indeed the Messiah King promised as the one to come by various Old Testament prophets. However, in real time 30 AD, it soon became apparent that Jesus was not fulfilling the Old Testament prophecy as His contemporaries expected. Their familiarity with kings and kingdoms involved political and military might, subjection of populations, and ruling with power. Since Jesus avoided these power structures altogether, what kind of kingdom could He be proclaiming? And what is its nature? One of the more perplexing aspects of Jesus‚Äô kingdom is its secret nature. This nature is brought into sharper focus as we investigate the Old and New Testament timeline in the announcement of the new kingdom; the kingdom of God, the kingdom of heaven, the kingdom of His beloved Son as it is variously called.
 In the Old Testament, proclamation was made loud and clear that a Messiah is coming. And this Messiah carries with Him a strong political significance. Quoting the ‚ÄúMessiah‚Äù entry in The Zondervan Pictorial Bible Dictionary, we read, ‚Äú[The Messiah] is to destroy the world powers in an act of judgment, deliver Israel from her enemies, and restore her as a nation. The Messiah is the King of this future kingdom to whose political and religious domination the other nations will yield. His mission is the redemption of Israel and His dominion is universal. This is the clear picture of the Messiah in practically all of the Old Testament passages which refer to Him.‚Äù
 In essence, The Messiah was to come with power and bring deliverance, judgment, and restoration. His future coming was called ‚Äúthe Day of the Lord,‚Äù and this proclamation, taking various forms and spokesmen, is a prominent theme throughout the Old Testament. Joel 1:15, 2:1,11,31, 3:14, Amos 5:18, Zeph. 1:14-16, and Mal. 4:1,5 use this phrase ‚Äì the Day of the Lord ‚Äì with various adjectives such as great, awesome, and terrible. The summary of the Old Testament prophecies regarding the Messiah King is that He would appear at the great and awesome Day of the Lord.
 With this background of Old Testament prophecy regarding the nature of the Messiah‚Äôs coming, we will continue our timeline next post with the arrival of the last of the ‚ÄúOld Testament‚Äù prophets; John the Baptist. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Imagine that you are a Jewish person living in 30 AD, expecting the arrival of the Messiah King to fulfill the Old Testament prophecies. However, Jesus arrives with a message that is different from what you expected. Write a journal entry expressing your thoughts, feelings, and questions about Jesus' proclamation of the kingdom of God.
 
 Describe your preconceived notions about the Messiah King based on the Old Testament prophecies.
 Explain how Jesus' message of the kingdom of God challenges or confirms these notions.
 Raise questions or concerns that you have about Jesus' kingdom, given its seemingly'secret' nature and lack of emphasis on political power and military might.

 To make your journal entry more authentic, consider adding more sensory details about the setting and atmosphere of Jerusalem during this time period. This could include descriptions of the sights, sounds, and smells of the city, as well as the emotions and reactions of the people around you.
 To better capture the complexity of your thoughts and feelings, try to incorporate more nuanced and introspective language. Instead of simply stating that Jesus' message is 'different' from what you expected, explore the specific ways in which it challenges or confirms your preconceived notions. What aspects of his message resonate with you, and what aspects seem foreign or unsettling?
 To make your questions more specific and thought-provoking, try to focus on the unique aspects of Jesus' kingdom that you find most puzzling or intriguing. For example, you might ask about the nature of Jesus' authority, the role of faith in his kingdom, or the relationship between his kingdom and the Old Testament prophecies.","### FEEDBACK: 200 Words or Less
 
 Your journal entry captures the complexity of expectations and realities surrounding Jesus' arrival. Here are some points to refine:
 
 1. **Preconceived Notions**: You accurately summarize the Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah, emphasizing deliverance, judgment, and restoration. Consider expanding on specific prophecies like Isaiah 9:6-7 and Daniel 7:13-14 to ground your expectations more firmly in scripture.
 
 2. **Challenges and Confirmations**: You effectively contrast Jesus' message with traditional expectations. However, consider how Jesus' teachings about love, forgiveness, and the poor might still align with Old Testament values. Highlighting these connections could strengthen your argument.
 
 3. **Questions and Concerns**: Your skepticism about the ""secret"" nature of Jesus' kingdom is valid. You might explore more deeply why Jesus avoids political and military power. Questions about how His kingdom functions and how it impacts daily life could add depth.
 
 4. **Emotional Tone**: Enhance the emotional tone by describing feelings of confusion, hope, and doubt. For example, ""I am filled with uncertainty; Jesus speaks of love and peace, but I long for deliverance from Roman rule.""
 
 Overall, your entry sets up a compelling dialogue between expectation and reality. Refining these areas will make your reflections even more insightful.

 Modern surgical techniques have come a long way in recent years. Fiber optics allow ear surgeons to perform delicate operations that would have been unheard of just decades ago. One of the most common procedures is known as myringotomy (MERE-IN-JOT-OH-ME), an operation that involves making a small hole in the eardrum and passing a tube through to drain excess fluid from the middle ear. It's particularly useful in treating children with ear infections. While many hearing disorders can be treated with antibiotics or other drugs, surgery may still be necessary in extreme cases. Most ear surgery is now considered to be both simple and safe. See an ear, nose and throat specialist when you detect the first sign of hearing loss, dizzy spells or other symptoms of ear ailments.

 Australasian Journal of Victorian Studies, Vol 15, No 2 (2010)
 In 1869, the Victorian naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace‚Äîco-founder with Darwin of the evolutionary theory of natural selection‚Äîpublished an account of the eight years he had spent in the Malay Archipelago. Just five years beforehand, in 1864, Wallace delivered a paper to the Anthropological Society of London, in which he declared that ‚Äúthe same great law of ‚Äòthe preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life‚Äô‚Äù was resulting in ‚Äúthe inevitable extinction of all those low and mentally undeveloped populations with which Europeans come in contact‚Äù. The 1864 and 1867 documents paint a sinister scenario indeed, casting interracial relations as an ‚Äúunequal‚Äù and violent ‚Äústruggle for existence‚Äù between the superior European races and the non-European races, whose mental, moral, and physical degradation doomed them to extinction. Representative of prevailing scientific opinions at the time, these observations stand in sharp contrast to The Malay Archipelago‚Äôs observations of happy and harmonious interracial relations in the archipelago, not to mention its praise of the physical and moral attributes of the ‚Äúsavages‚Äù there.
 For the humans of Wallace‚Äôs archipelago, life appears to be as Edenic as the natural environment they inhabit. The question I would like to address here is, why did Wallace emphasize the virtuous qualities of the very races he had described as lowly in almost every respect? And why did he concentrate on the interracial harmony in the region rather than the deadly interracial struggle he expressed belief in only a few years before? \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Critical Analysis: Wallace's Altering Perspective
 
 Analyze the disparities in Alfred Russel Wallace's depiction of non-European populations between his 1864 paper and his 1869 publication of The Malay Archipelago, and argue whether his altered perspective represents a genuine shift in his scientific opinion or a literary device to promote a particular worldview.

 3. **Motivation**: Explore possible motivations for his change. Was it personal experience, public reaction, or evolving scientific understanding?
 
 4. **Literary Device**: Address the possibility that Wallace used the portrayal of interracial harmony as a literary device to appeal to a wider audience. This could also reflect changes in his personal beliefs over time.

"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
 Researcher Doris Jones has unearthed startling new evidence demonstrating that fluoride interferes with enzyme systems, damaging many organ systems of the body.
 The fluoride issue, a perennial hot potato, is heating up once again. In Britain, the government has recently announced its intention to fluoridate the water of deprived inner city areas, supposedly to improve the dental health of children living there. Later, water fluoridation may be introduced nationwide. A White Paper outlining the government's plans is scheduled for this spring.
 The government and the dental profession have convinced the public that fluoridated water offers nothing but benefits that there is overwhelming evidence that it prevents tooth decay and contributes to the strength of bones. There is tacit admission in the pro fluoride camp that fluoride can also cause harm, but only at high levels: more than 2 ppm in water may cause mottled teeth and over 8 ppm may lead to bone disorders and degenerative changes in the vital organs.
 A few lone voices have countered the prevailing view, with published evidence that fluoride can have devastating effects, causing mottled teeth and osteoporosis at very low levels. While much has been written about the effects of too much fluoride on teeth and bones, little is known about the effects of fluoride on the rest of the body.
 But new evidence has emerged demonstrating that it can have devastating effects on just about every organ in the body, and may even be partly responsible for behavioural problems like hyperactivity and many puzzling illnesses like ME.
 Like mercury, fluoride isn't exactly an obvious choice for dental health as it is a poison more poisonous than lead and only slightly less poisonous than arsenic (Clin Toxicol Commerc Prod, 1984; 11: 4, 112, 129, 138). It's been used as a pesticide, and it's a component in fungicides, rodenticides, anaesthetics and many drugs. The fluoride used in toothpaste, mouth rinses and dental gels is usually sodium fluoride, a waste product from the aluminium industry. Fluoride added to our water supply is hydrofluorosilic acid or sometimes silicofluoride waste products of fertiliser and glass industries.
 The late US fluoride critic George L Waldbott discovered that, besides teeth and bones, fluoride can damage soft tissue. According to his research, the small fluorine ion with a high charge density can penetrate every cell of the body and combine with other ions (GL Waldbott et al, Fluoride: The Great Dilemma, Lawrence, Kansas: Corenado Press, 1978: 148-74). It interferes with the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus and the function of the parathyroid glands.
 It has a strong affinity to calcium, but will also readily combine with magnesium and manganese ions and so can interfere with many enzyme systems that require these minerals. The interruption of these enzyme systems, in turn, may disturb carbohydrate metabolism, bone formation and muscle function. Indeed, every vital function in the body depends on enzymes; because fluoride easily reaches every organ, many diverse toxic symptoms can result.
 Fluoride and enzymes
 Enzyme systems react to fluoride in different ways; some are activated, others are inhibited. Lipase (essential for the digestion of fat) and phosphatases (needed to breakdown phosphates) are very sensitive to fluoride. In patients with skeletal fluorosis, succinate dehydrogenase activity is inhibited. In chronic fluoride poisoning, this diminished enzyme activity accounts for muscular weakness and even muscle wasting. Human salivary acid phosphatase is diminished by half when exposed to 3.8 ppm of fluoride. The blood enzyme cholinesterase is inhibited by 61 per cent on exposure to 0.95 ppm fluoride an amount within recommended levels adversely affecting functions of the nervous system (PA Smith, ed, Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology, Berlin: Springer Verlag, 1970: 48-97). \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Imagine you are a team of researchers conducting an experiment on the effects of fluoride on human health.
 
 Choose an enzyme system mentioned in the article and design a study to investigate how varying levels of fluoride exposure impact its activity and related bodily functions.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 We will investigate the effects of fluoride on cholinesterase enzyme activity. Cholinesterase is responsible for the breakdown of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in the nervous system. We will design a study with three groups of 100 participants, each exposed to different levels of fluoride: 0.5 ppm, 2 ppm and 8 ppm. Participants blood cholinesterase levels will be measured before and after fluoride exposure. Additionally, participants will complete cognitive and motor function tests to assess the impact of fluoride on the nervous system.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: Your study design is a good start, but it needs more details and consideration of potential limitations.
 
 You should specify the duration of the study and the frequency of cholinesterase level measurements to ensure accurate results.
 Consider adding a control group that is not exposed to fluoride to compare the results and determine the impact of fluoride on cholinesterase activity.
 You should also consider the potential confounding variables, such as age, sex, and pre-existing health conditions, and how they will be controlled for in the study.","### FEEDBACK: 200 Words or Less
 
 Your proposal is clear and well-structured, focusing on a specific enzyme system (cholinesterase) and its potential impact from fluoride exposure. Here are some points for improvement:
 
 1. **Sample Size**: While 100 participants per group is reasonable, ensure that the sample is representative of the population in terms of age, sex, and health status. Consider including a control group with no fluoride exposure for better comparison.
 
 2. **Measurement Timing**: Specify the duration of fluoride exposure and the intervals at which cholinesterase levels will be measured. This will help establish the timeline for observing changes.
 
 3. **Exposure Method**: Clarify how fluoride will be administered (e.g., water, topical application). Ensure that the method mimics real-world exposure to avoid confounding variables.
 
 4. **Cognitive and Motor Tests**: Define the specific tests and their reliability. Include a brief rationale for selecting these tests based on the expected impact of fluoride on cholinesterase activity.
 
 5. **Ethical Considerations**: Mention any ethical approvals required and measures to protect participant safety, especially given the potential toxicity of fluoride.
 
 6. **Data Analysis**: Outline your plan for analyzing data, such as statistical methods to compare cholinesterase levels across groups.
 
 Overall, your approach is solid. Enhancing these details will strengthen the feasibility and rigor of your study.",A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Support for the appeal of protective measures against the airborne spread of Covid-19
 A publication by Lidia Morawska and Donald K. Milton in the journal ""Clinical Infectious Diseases"" (CID) published on Monday appeals for attention to the role of airborne microdroplets and aerosols in the spread of Covid-19.
 239 scientists from 32 countries have signed the paper entitled ""It is time to Adress Airborne Transmission of COVID-19"" as supporters (1). One of these supporters of the appeal is Professor Hartmut Herrmann, head of the Atmospheric Chemistry Department (ACD) at the Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research (TROPOS).
 The Morawska and Milton Declaration addresses the medical community and the responsible national and international authorities, not least the WHO. It clearly emphasizes that the protective measures recommended so far against the infection and spread of Covid-19 viruses should be supplemented everywhere by ventilation and air exchange measures, as otherwise these do not provide sufficient protection against transmission by floating microdroplets or droplet nuclei.
 Depending on the particle size, one distinguishes droplets (larger than 5 ¬µm) from smaller particles (droplet nuclei or infectious aerosols, smaller than 5 ¬µm). The transformation is fluent; droplet nuclei can be generated from droplet size particles by drying out in the air (2).
 Especially the WHO (Worlds Health Organisation) or also the American health authority CDC do not sufficiently warn of the danger of the long-lived infectious particles floating in the air, according to the author and the supporters.
 The German Robert Koch Institute (RKI) confirms: ""Longer time spent in small, poorly ventilated or unventilated rooms can increase the probability of infection by aerosols even over a distance of more than 2 m (...). An effective air exchange can reduce the aerosol concentration in a room"". (2)
 Also in Germany, where at present public life is gradually returning and many institutions are reopening, we must consider whether the recommendations take sufficient account of the aspect of airborne infectious particles and, if necessary, adjust measures accordingly. A possible renunciation of the wearing of masks should therefore be based on caution and carefulness and does not appear to be appropriate at the moment.
 The statement by Lidia Morowska and Donald K. Milton includes concrete recommendations for implementation:
 - Provide sufficient and effective ventilation (supply clean outdoor air, minimize recirculating air) particularly in public buildings, workplace environments, schools, hospitals, and aged care homes.
 - Supplement general ventilation with airborne infection controls such as local exhaust, high efficiency air filtration, and germicidal ultraviolet lights.
 - Avoid overcrowding, particularly in public transport and public buildings
 Prof. Herrmann and the Director of TROPOS, Prof. Macke, and thus TROPOS as a whole, support the appeal that the aerosol aspect should not be ignored in the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

 Critically evaluate the implications of the Morawska and Milton Declaration on the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in regards to airborne transmission and ventilation measures in public spaces.
 
 In your response, consider the recommendations outlined in the declaration, the stance of international health authorities such as the WHO, and the potential consequences of neglecting the aerosol aspect of virus transmission.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 The Morawska and Milton Declaration highlights the significance of airborne transmission in the spread of COVID-19, emphasizing the need for enhanced ventilation measures in public spaces. The declaration's recommendations, which include sufficient ventilation, avoidance of overcrowding, and supplementation with airborne infection controls, are critical in mitigating the transmission of the virus. However, the WHO's stance on airborne transmission remains conservative, contradicting the declaration's findings. Neglecting the aerosol aspect of virus transmission could lead to increased infections, particularly in poorly ventilated spaces. Therefore, it is essential to reassess and revise existing guidelines to prioritize ventilation measures and minimize the risk of airborne transmission.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: 200 Words or Less
 
 Your response effectively captures the essence of the Morawska and Milton Declaration and its implications for global pandemic response. Here are some areas for improvement:
 
 1. **Specificity and Detail**: While you mention the WHO‚Äôs conservative stance, it would be beneficial to provide more context about their current guidelines and why they differ from the declaration. This adds depth to your critique.
 
 2. **Evidence and Examples**: Include specific examples of how neglecting airborne transmission has led to outbreaks in poorly ventilated settings. This would strengthen your argument and make it more convincing.
 
 3. **Recommendations Clarity**: Clarify the distinction between general ventilation and supplementary measures like high-efficiency air filtration and germicidal UV lights. Explain how these different methods complement each other.
 
 4. **Consequences**: Elaborate on the potential consequences of neglecting airborne transmission. Discuss both immediate health risks and broader economic and social impacts.
 
 Here‚Äôs a revised version incorporating these points:
 
 ""The Morawska and Milton Declaration underscores the critical role of airborne transmission in spreading COVID-19, advocating for enhanced ventilation measures in public spaces. The declaration recommends sufficient general ventilation, avoiding overcrowding, and supplementing with airborne infection controls such as high-efficiency air filtration and germicidal UV lights. In contrast, the WHO‚Äôs guidelines remain conservative, focusing primarily on surface contact and droplet transmission. Neglecting airborne transmission has led to significant outbreaks in poorly ventilated environments, such as meatpacking plants and indoor gatherings. Consequently, revising guidelines to prioritize ventilation measures is crucial. Failure to address this could result in increased infections, prolonged lockdowns, and severe economic repercussions.""
 
 Keep up the good work and focus on adding specific examples and detailed explanations to enhance your analysis.","### FEEDBACK: The response provides a good overview of the implications of the Morawska and Milton Declaration, but lacks depth and supporting evidence.

 What is the Difference in Profit per Acre between Organic and Conventional Coffee?
 AbstractThe research addresses the economic problem of deforestation. A contributing factor to deforestation is coffee production. Coffee is an indigenous plant that is naturally occurring in the native tropical forests. However, conventional coffee is grown on cleared forest soil. In the native forest there is the potential for additional fruits (bananas, mangoes, avocados) and wood products while in the conventional coffee production system the only product is coffee. Conventional coffee production often causes deforestation and soil erosion while the organic coffee production system does not. In addition, the price risk associated with the coffee monoculture is high and has proven disastrous to the sustainability of coffee production in past years. Thus, determining the comparative cost and return between the two methods can provide important information for coffee producers. The purpose of the research is to determine the per acre profitability between conventional and organic coffee. This will be determined by researching the distribution of quantity on representative plots. This will help identify any size or scale economies. Determining the difference in profit per acre between organic and conventional coffee production included identifying and working with production stakeholders, engaging in fieldwork, site and case study selection, and determining measurable, non-market benefits and costs that pertain to environmental and community factors.

 Comparative Analysis of Organic and Conventional Coffee Production Systems
 
 Assuming you are a consultant for a coffee farm in Costa Rica, design a 500-word report comparing the economic and environmental impacts of organic and conventional coffee production systems.
 
 
 ### ANSWER:
 Organic coffee production systems have lower yields and higher labor costs, but offer higher prices and greater species variation, while conventional systems have higher yields and lower costs, but contribute to deforestation and soil erosion. Organic coffee production systems have a higher profit per acre, $X, compared to conventional, $Y",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: 200 WORDS OR LESS
 
 Your comparison highlights some key differences between organic and conventional coffee production systems, but requires more detailed analysis and data to fully support your claims. Here are specific areas to improve:
 
 1. **Quantitative Data**: Include specific figures for yield, labor costs, and profit per acre. Use concrete examples from Costa Rican farms to substantiate your points.
 
 2. **Environmental Impacts**: Expand on how each system affects biodiversity, water quality, and soil health. For instance, mention that organic systems promote polycultures which enhance biodiversity, whereas conventional systems can lead to significant soil degradation.
 
 3. **Economic Benefits**: Discuss long-term economic benefits like market premiums and brand loyalty for organic coffee, which can outweigh initial higher costs.
 
 4. **Stakeholder Perspectives**: Consider input from farmers, consumers, and policymakers. How do they perceive the trade-offs between organic and conventional systems?
 
 5. **Risk Management**: Analyze how each system handles price volatility and market risks. Organic coffee often commands premium prices due to consumer preference for sustainable practices.
 
 6. **Clarity and Structure**: Ensure your report is logically structured. Introduce each section clearly and conclude with a summary of findings and recommendations.
 
 By addressing these points, your report will provide a comprehensive analysis that effectively compares the economic and environmental impacts of both systems.","### FEEDBACK: The report provides a good comparison of organic and conventional coffee production systems, but lacks specific data and calculations to support the claims.

 LAWSUIT TO BE FILED TO PROTECT GREEN STURGEON
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: February 20, 2003
 Conservation organizations formally notified the Bush Administration of their intent to initiate legal action to protect the green sturgeon, challenging its January 29, 2003 determination not to list the ancient fish species under the Endangered Species Act. The notice of intent to sue was filed by the Environmental Protection Information Center (EPIC), Center for Biological Diversity (CBD), and the Oregon Natural Resources Council (ONRC).
 The decision came from the U.S. Department of Commerce's NOAA Fisheries (formally known as the National Marine Fisheries Service) more than seven months overdue, and was only issued after conservation organizations sued the agency to force it to make a determination. The organizations initially filed a scientific petition to list the green sturgeon in June 2001, documenting precipitous declines in this fish species that has survived more than 200 million years.
 Conservationists strongly dispute NOAA Fisheries'
 determination that the green sturgeon ""neither appears to be declining
 in population numbers or are in danger of extinction."" Only three
 river systems are known to support green sturgeon today, in the Klamath-Trinity,
 Sacramento, and Rogue Rivers, with the species divided into at least two
 distinct populations that apparently do not interbreed. Each population
 is believed to consist of only a few hundred female fish of breeding age,
 The greenish-gold, bony fish look prehistoric, with a skeleton consisting of mostly cartilage and rows of bony plates for scales. They have snouts like shovels and mouths like vacuum cleaners that are used to siphon shrimp and other food from the sandy depths. The green sturgeon, unlike most other species of sturgeon, spawns in cold water and gravel habitat similar to what is required for salmon and steelhead trout.
 ""Siltation from clearcut logging, de-watering of rivers, and agricultural and land development have largely eliminated the deep holes and river habitat that green sturgeon require,"" Jeff Miller of CBD said. ""The same severe water quality and quantity problems that have impacted salmon in the Pacific Northwest have also decimated green sturgeon,"" Miller added.
 In marine waters, the green sturgeon ranges from Mexico to Alaska and it feeds in estuaries and bays from Monterey Bay to British Columbia. A number of spawning populations of green sturgeon in California have been presumed lost since the 1960s and 1970s - in the Eel River, South Fork Trinity River, and San Joaquin River. Severe declines of green sturgeon have been noted recently in northern rivers that may have once had spawning populations, including the Umpqua River in Oregon and the Fraser River in Canada.
 ""Many scientists have come to believe that the Klamath-Trinity river system is the center of the universe for green sturgeon. In a major fish kill on the Klamath River in late September 2002, a few green sturgeon were also reported among the various fish species that made up 5% of the fish kill that overall destroyed at least 33,000 chinook salmon,"" said Wendell Wood, Southern Oregon Field Representative for ONRC.
 In October, a federal biologist with the (then) National Marine Fisheries Service went public with accusations that the administration had ignored his findings that increased water flows were essential to protecting salmon listed under the Endangered Species Act. ""Conservationists are concerned about a developing pattern of Bush Administration interference that has withheld significant scientific recommendations as well as economic reports demonstrating the major economic and ecological importance of the Klamath River,"" Wood said.
 More information about the green sturgeon, a copy of the listing petition, and color photos of the species are available on the EPIC website at www.wildcalifornia.org, the CBD web site at . An illustration of the green sturgeon is available courtesy of NOAA at www.psmfc.org/habitat/edu_gsturg_image.html.
 More Information on Green Sturgeon
 Sturgeon are modern relicts of the ancient group of bony fishes, and have a skeleton that is mostly cartilage rather than bone and rows of bony plates for protection instead of scales. The sturgeon has a shovel-like snout and vacuum cleaner-like mouth that it uses to siphon food.
 Green sturgeon spend a lot of time in river estuaries and in the ocean, moving upstream mostly to spawn. A few spawning sites have been identified, mostly on the Klamath River. One pool on the Klamath is known to be particularly active. Leaping and jostling fish crowd into a place called ""The Sturgeon Hole,"" about a mile upstream from Orleans, California, in spring and early summer. To a lesser degree, spawning also occurs in the Sacramento River, especially in one of its tributaries, the Feather River, and in the Rogue River in southern Oregon.
 Green sturgeon spawn in the freshwater of only a few large rivers, all of which have diversions, dams, and sediment problems that limit sufficient water flow and suitable spawning conditions. The San Francisco Bay population of green sturgeon has been estimated to fluctuate between 500 and 1000 adult fish in the last few decades. While the exact size of the Klamath Basin green sturgeon population is unknown, it is likely the largest spawning population. It is believed that the spawning population in the Eel River (south of Eureka, CA) disappeared by the 1970s, although a few adult sturgeon have been found upstream in recent years.
 In addition to habitat destruction, historic over-fishing was a major cause of decline of the green sturgeon - present fisheries probably continue to deplete a stock of large, old fish that cannot renew itself at present harvest rates. Sturgeons are highly vulnerable to over-fishing because of the long time it takes them to reach breeding maturity, and their infrequent reproductive success. Their large size and sluggish nature make them easy to net and snag.
 Until recently, various West Coast fisheries were harvesting at least 6,000 to 11,000 green sturgeon per year. In recent years, the annual harvest has been estimated at 3,000 to 5,000 adult fish. More restrictive sturgeon size limit fishing regulations have been gradually implemented in California, Oregon, and Washington - mainly aimed to protect the larger and more common white sturgeon, but which allow many of the large breeding-age green sturgeon to be caught.
 In North America only seven sturgeon species may now remain.
 Until recently, eight species of sturgeon occurred in North America--four of which (plus one population of the white sturgeon) are already listed as endangered or threatened; the Shortnose sturgeon, Gulf sturgeon, Pallid sturgeon, Alabama sturgeon, and the Kootenai River population of the white sturgeon.
 On September 17, 2002, the last known Alabama sturgeon, a male named ""bubba,"" died in a state fish hatchery. The Alabama sturgeon was formerly widespread throughout 1,000 miles of the Mobile River Basin of Alabama and Mississippi. While hope remains that a few wild Alabama sturgeon may still be found somewhere in the Cahaba and Alabama Rivers, intensive fish surveys and widespread recreational fishing have failed to find any since 1999. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
 Morning sickness refers to a state or feelings of nausea, vomiting or sickness during the early part of pregnancy which occurs especially in the morning. Why is it called morning sickness? Simply because, it is a feeling of sickness; and it starts at the beginning of the day (not necessarily). For most women the signs appear during the start of the day but goes away as the day progresses, while some other may feel it either at the later part of the day or even the whole day.
 It does not happen to all women in pregnancy. It may happen to some and not to others. According to an estimate, about 3 quarters of women feel morning sickness during the first three months of their pregnancy.
 The earliest time it starts is normally four weeks or five weeks and in some cases as late as six weeks. All women do not experience the same starting time, or length. Some may feel it as early as four weeks, while other may start the feeling even after the 6th week. However, the majority of women get the nausea and vomiting feeling just about the first four weeks.
 How long does morning sickness last?
 There is no exact answer to that. Some women would get relief just about in two weeks after its appearance, while other may feel better in about 5 to 9 weeks, some around 14 weeks and some even later than that. Generally speaking, around 50% of pregnant women find themselves relieved from morning sickness by 14th week. While some other may take even a month or so longer. In a few other cases, it may become more severe, in which case, it is called as hyperemesis gracidarum. Such excessive cases of nausea and vomiting has been observed in a very small group of women which may lead to weight loss and dehydration because of the lack of absorption of food and liquids in to the body in the right amount.
 Causes of Morning Sickness
 What causes it? Who gets it? Why certain women get it and others don‚Äôt? There are no exact and scientific answers to these questions. There are some studies which have probed into the matter and have come up only with some general observations.
 Some of the reports indicate that Morning Sickness, most probably, occurs because of the changing levels of the hormones after a woman conceives. The hormones level rise above the normal level enabling the body to cope with the new situations.
 But again, the question remains why the hormone level rise in some women during their pregnancy and not in others? It is not known exactly. It may be due to the overall psychical makeup of the body, health condition, the immune system and other factors. So, the general observation is that some women get more morning sickness than others, without exactly knowing the underlying causes or reasons behind it.
 Typically speaking, there are a couple of causes which are generally associated with nausea and vomiting during pregnancy without any clear scientific evidence. For example, women with twins or more babies have more chances to suffer from morning sickness than the women pregnant with only one baby. This could be because of the production of high levels of hormones in their bodies such as, HCG, estrogens etc. Also those women who used to take birth control pills before they were pregnant have more chances to suffer than the ones who did not. Women who have a family history are likely to suffer more than those who not. In other words, genetic factor is responsible to a certain extent for causing nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.
 What about the relationship of morning sickness with a baby girl or a baby boy? Does it have an effect in case of gender of the baby? There, certainly, have been debates regarding this issue i.e. what is the effect of the morning sickness on women carrying a boy and on women carrying a girl. According to a study, it was found that those women who were pregnant with baby girls were 50 percent higher than those pregnant with boys.
 There is another issue, much less debatable, that women having miscarriages have no or low morning sickness as compared to those who have successful pregnancies. The logic or reason behind this is that women with miscarriages do not have the babies or placenta developing and, as such, have lower levels of hormones. As there system does not require a high level of hormones so they do not have the feeling of nausea or vomiting.
 On the other hand, women who have successful pregnancies have the babies or placenta developing in them and hence their body needs a high level of hormones. This may be true to some extent. However, that does not mean that a successful pregnancy is definitely related to morning sickness as there are a lot many women out there who delivered quite well without feeling sick or vomiting while they were pregnant.
 How to Ease?
 What are the ways that can ease or relieve morning sickness? Are there any? Yes, there are! In most cases, doctors and midwives will not prescribe any medication as long as they see it as a normal part of pregnancy. However, there are some very useful and easy steps which if followed can get one a good relief. In case of more severe cases, one should always speak to the doctor and act upon the advice that is recommended by him or her. Here a couple of steps which may help to reduce morning sickness.
 1) Change eating habits. That means to eat smaller bits during the day rather than one large meal.
 2) Avoid the stomach either being completely full or empty.
 3) Take a good rest during the day.
 4) Avoid smelling places like kitchen.
 5) Substitute the nausea and vomiting causing food with the ones that don‚Äôt trigger morning sickness.
 6) Consider using acupressure or motion sickness bands.
 Morning Sickness Frequently Asked Questions
 1) What is Morning Sickness?
 A general definition of Morning Sickness would be a state or a feeling of nausea and vomiting in the early part of pregnancy especially during the morning.
 2) When does morning sickness start?
 Answer: No fixed time. It may start early as well as late. Round from first to the 6th week is the normal time. Few women have seen it as early as the 1st week.
 3) How long does morning sickness last?
 Answer: It may last a few days or a few weeks. Generally, goes away after 4 weeks.
 4) What does morning sickness feel like?
 Answer: It feels like you are motion sick. You simply feel sick, vomiting or nausea.
 5) When does morning sickness end?
 Answer: No exact end times. Generally improvement starts after the first few weeks. In some rare cases may last up to 14 weeks or even later.
 6) What causes morning sickness?
 Answer: No exact cause known. It may be due to the rising levels of hormones. Common triggers are spicy or sharp smelling food, empty stomach or being too full at one time.
 7) When do you get morning sickness?
 Answer: It has been associated with pregnancy. Any sickness other than pregnancy is generally not referred to as morning sickness. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

 John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon participated in the first live, televised debate as a part of the campaign of 1960. Those who watched the telecast thought Kennedy had won, largely because he looked calm, physically in control, and attractive, whereas Nixon had a 5 o'clock shadow and appeared nervous. Those who listened to the debate on the radio thought Nixon had won.
 Because of its ability to reach so many people, television had an impact on American culture-even more so than writers like Ayn Rand could. It was a way of connecting one part of the country to the other, thus minimizing cultural and regional differences. Television was an avenue for bringing the nation together. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Analyze the impact of the 1960 presidential debate on American politics and society.

 ### ANSWER:
 The 1960 presidential debate between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon signified a pivotal moment in American politics and society. The debate's live, televised format influenced viewers' perceptions, as those who watched on television perceived Kennedy as the winner due to his calm and attractive appearance, whereas radio listeners thought Nixon won. This disparity highlights the differential impact of visual versus auditory information on public opinion. The debate also underscored television's capacity to connect the country, diminish regional differences, and unite the nation. This broader cultural significance of television was exemplified in its ability to transcend geographical boundaries and introduce a new level of intimacy with the candidates, which had a lasting impact on American politics and culture.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: 200 Words or Less
 
 Your analysis captures the essence of the 1960 presidential debate's impact on American politics and society. Here are some points to refine and expand upon:
 
 1. **Specificity and Evidence**: While you mention that Kennedy appeared calm and attractive, and Nixon seemed nervous, consider adding more specific details from the text. For example, note Nixon's ""five o'clock shadow"" and Kennedy‚Äôs poised demeanor. These details strengthen your argument.
 
 2. **Broader Cultural Impact**: You touch on how television connected the nation and minimized regional differences. Expand on this by discussing how television's role in shaping public opinion during the debate marked a shift towards visual media influencing political outcomes. 
 
 3. **Audience Perception**: Highlight the contrast between television and radio audiences more clearly. Mention that television viewers were swayed by visual cues, while radio listeners focused on substance. This dual perspective underscores the debate's significance.
 
 4. **Historical Context**: Consider the broader context of the 1960s, where television was becoming a dominant force in American life. Discuss how this debate set a precedent for future campaigns to focus on visual presentation and media strategy.

 Royal Niger CompanyFlag of the Royal Niger Company
 Sir George Taubman Goldie conceived the idea of adding to the British empire the then little known regions of the lower and middle Niger River, and for over twenty years his efforts were devoted to the realization of this conception. The method by which he determined to work was the revival of government by chartered companies within the empire, a method supposed to be buried with the British East India Company. The first step was to combine all British commercial interests in the Niger, and this he accomplished in 1879 when the United African Company was formed. In 1881 Goldie sought a charter from Gladstone's government but his attempts failed.
 At this time French traders, encouraged by L√©on Gambetta, established themselves on the lower river, thus rendering it difficult for the company to obtain territorial rights; but the Frenchmen were bought out in 1884, so that at the Berlin Conference on West Africa in 1885, Goldie, present as an expert on matters relating to the river, was able to announce that on the lower Niger the British flag alone flew. Meantime the Niger coast line had been placed under British protection. Over 400 political treaties drawn up by Goldie were made with the chiefs of the lower Niger and the Hausa states. The scruples of the British government being overcome, a charter was at length granted (July 1886), the National African Company becoming the Royal Niger Company, with Henry Austin Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare as governor and Goldie as vice-governor.
 It was, however, evidently impossible for a chartered company to hold its own against the state-supported protectorates of France and Germany, and in consequence, on January 1, 1900, the Royal Niger Company transferred its territories to the British government for the sum of ¬£865,000. The ceded territory together with the small Niger Coast Protectorate, already under imperial control, was formed into the two protectorates of northern and southern Nigeria.

 Your response provides a good overview but lacks detail and structure. Here‚Äôs how you can improve:
 
 1. **Steps Taken by Sir George Taubman Goldie**:
  - **Combine Interests**: Mention that Goldie combined British commercial interests into the United African Company in 1879.
  - **Seek Charter**: Note his unsuccessful attempt to secure a charter from Gladstone's government in 1881.
  - **Negotiate with French Traders**: Highlight his efforts to buy out French traders by 1884.
 
 2. **Impact of French Traders**:
  - **Initial Challenge**: Explain that French traders established themselves on the lower Niger, complicating territorial rights for the company.
  - **Resolution**: Emphasize that Goldie bought out these French traders, securing the area for Britain.
 
 3. **Long-Term Impact**:
  - **Territorial Control**: Discuss how the company secured over 400 treaties with local chiefs.
  - **Charter Granting**: Mention the granting of a charter in 1886, forming the Royal Niger Company.
  - **Transfer to Government**: Describe the transfer of territories to the British government in 1900 and the formation of Northern and Southern Nigeria.
 
 Here‚Äôs a revised version incorporating these points:
 
 ""The Royal Niger Company significantly contributed to the British Empire's expansion in West Africa by reviving the concept of government by chartered companies.

In 1900, the company transferred its territories to the British government for ¬£865,000, leading to the creation of Northern and Southern Nigeria.""
 
 This structured approach ensures clarity and completeness.","### FEEDBACK: The Royal Niger Company significantly contributed to the British Empire's expansion in West Africa by reviving the concept of government by chartered companies, combining British commercial interests in the Niger, and obtaining territorial rights through treaties. Sir George Taubman Goldie's efforts to revive the concept of government by chartered companies were successful, as he was able to obtain a charter for the Royal Niger Company in 1886. The company's ability to obtain territorial rights was initially hindered by the presence of French traders on the lower Niger River, but this issue was resolved through the purchase of the French traders' interests in 1884. The formation of the Royal Niger Company had a significant long-term impact on the development of colonial West Africa, as it led to the eventual transfer of the company's territories to the British government in 1900, which in turn led to the formation of the two protectorates of northern and southern Nigeria.

 The Lenape call themselves the Lenni Lenape, which means ""original people."" There are three divisions of the tribe.
 Their flag carries many symbols that reflect their culture. The mask in the center of the flag represents Mesingw, the ""Masked Spirit"", who is the guardian of the creatures of the forest. The forest animals were as important to the Lenape as the buffalo were to the natives of the plains.
 European settlers pushed the nation from Delaware through 16 states, including Ontario, to Oklahoma where many of them live today.
 They used copper to make pipes and ornaments. These were traded along with pottery, dressed deerskin, beads, and feather mantels. They used their pottery to store corn, beans and tobacco, which they grew along with sweet potatoes and squash.
 Dyes from certain vegetables and minerals were used for picture writing to record history and communicate and to paint themselves for ceremonies and battle.
 In the beginning, the nation was at ease with the new settlers, but when the settlers began to take what was theirs, the warriors took action. The Lenni Lenape Historical Society and Museum has records of these events.

"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
 Recently I was going over my notes for my classes on the indigenous civilizations that flourished in Latin America before the arrival of the Europeans. I had two points on both the Aztezs of Mexico and the Incas of Peru: legend and history.
 I became intrigued by my separation of these two ‚Äúrealities‚Äù and wondered why they shouldn‚Äôt be one and the same. Perhaps it is because we look at the ‚Äúhistorical‚Äù as provable facts and ‚Äúlegend‚Äù as not being scientific. The more I thought about it, the more it occurred to me that our separation of these two realities stems from western dualism; the separation of body and soul. The historical is from the brain, or the intellect, while the legendary is from the soul (Greek = psyche, or the unconscious in depth psychology terms).
 Carl Jung, the great Swiss psychiatrist, made a career of studying the archetypal images that bubbled up from the soul (unconscious) that could be found in common in all cultures. Many of these images are ensconced in legends, myths and fairy tales. And many of these legends appear in similar fashion in cultures around the world. Creation stories are a good example of this.
 The historical view of how the Americas were populated show roaming tribes crossing the Bering Strait from Asia or coming in boats across the Pacific Ocean from Polynesia. Yet the indigenous cultures in Latin America have their own creation stories which have many parallels to the Genesis account. God created them in their own land, they did not migrate from some other place. Is that any less believable than our view that somehow God created humankind in Mesopotamia? I won‚Äôt argue whether our view of creation is historical or not. The fact that similar stories about creation arise around the world is what fascinates me.
 My view is that these creation stories, as well as many others that cultures around the world hold in common, come from the indelible stamp of the ‚Äúimage of God‚Äù on our souls. Whether you call it the collective unconscious as Jung did, or the soul as I did, these archetypal images and tales give humankind a longing for a relationship with our creator, and a restlessness until we find the meaning for our existence in our God-likeness.
 We see the combination of history and legend in many of our Christian celebrations. Christmas, for example, was placed during the time of pagan celebrations of the winter solstice when the ancients feared that darkness would encompass the whole world rendering it lifeless. The festival of lights ceremonies to placate the gods into bringing back the sun is why we have candles and lights at Christmas. The ancients in the Americas had similar ceremonies during the winter solstice.
 The historically minded would call this syncretism. I would call this proof of a longing for God that is stamped into the soul of every human being on the face of the earth, and a preparation of the soul for the arrival of Christ.
 History or legend? It doesn‚Äôt need to be either or. In my view, it is both history and legend. The two do not have to compete with each other. With the one we see with the eyes of our minds, with the other we see with the eyes of our souls. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
 Explain how the concept of the collective unconscious, as proposed by Carl Jung, can be used to understand the shared archetypal images and creation stories across cultures, drawing on examples from both indigenous Latin American civilizations and Christian traditions.
 
 Analyze the creation stories of at least two cultures and identify common archetypal images or themes.
 Discuss how these shared images reflect a universal longing for a relationship with a creator or higher power.
 Evaluate the relationship between history and legend in these stories, considering the idea that they are not mutually exclusive.

 The collective unconscious proposed by Carl Jung explains how shared archetypal images and creation stories across cultures are possible.",Yes,"### FEEDBACK: 200 Words or Less
 
 Your exploration of the collective unconscious and its role in shared archetypal images and creation stories is insightful. Here are some areas to refine:
 
 1. **Clarity and Structure**: Your response is somewhat disjointed. Consider organizing your answer into clear sections: introduction, explanation of the collective unconscious, analysis of creation stories, reflection on shared themes, and conclusion. This will make your argument more coherent.
 
 2. **Specific Examples**: You mention the Aztecs and Incas but don't provide detailed examples of their creation stories. Including specific elements like the Aztec's *Five Suns* myth or the Inca's *Creation of Manco Capac* would strengthen your analysis.
 
 3. **Themes and Longing**: Discuss the common themes more explicitly. For instance, the motif of a divine creator, the emergence of humanity from the earth, or the struggle against chaos. These reflect a universal longing for connection with a higher power.
 
 4. **Synthesis of History and Legend**: Elaborate on how these stories blend history and legend. Highlight how both can coexist without contradiction, enriching our understanding of cultural heritage. 
 
 5. **Christian Parallels**: Connect the Christian traditions more closely to the collective unconscious. For example, discuss how pagan festivals influenced Christmas traditions, reflecting a deeper spiritual yearning.
 
 Overall, your ideas are promising. Focus on providing concrete examples and a structured argument to enhance clarity and impact.","### FEEDBACK: The response provides a good starting point for understanding the concept of the collective unconscious, but lacks depth and supporting evidence.
 
 To strengthen the argument, consider providing specific examples of creation stories from indigenous Latin American civilizations, such as the Aztecs or Incas, and compare them to Christian creation stories, highlighting common archetypal images or themes.
 To further develop the discussion, explore how these shared images reflect a universal longing for a relationship with a creator or higher power, and consider the implications of this concept for our understanding of human culture and spirituality.
 To address the final task, evaluate the relationship between history and legend in these stories, considering the idea that they are not mutually exclusive, and discuss how this concept challenges or reinforces our understanding of the collective unconscious.",B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 White blood cell levels are a good predictor of strokes, heart attacks, and fatal heart disease in older women, according to a nationwide study. White cell counts can be easily measured by inexpensive, widely available tests, raising the possibility of lowering the toll of heart disease fatalities, the leading cause of death among women in the United States.
 ""For years, researchers have suspected a link between elevated white blood cell count and heart attack,"" notes JoAnn Manson, one of the study leaders and Elizabeth F. Brigham Professor of Women's Health at Harvard Medical School. ""The present study is the largest to test this association and provides the strongest evidence to date that WBC (white blood cell) count predicts the risk of heart attack.""
 As part of the federally supported Women's Health Initiative, investigators at medical centers all over the United States collected information on 72,242 postmenopausal women 50 to 79 years old. All were free of heart and blood vessel disease at the start of the study. During six years of follow-up, 1,626 heart disease deaths, heart attacks, and strokes occurred. Women with more than 6.7 billion white cells per liter of blood had more than double the risk of fatal heart disease than women with 4.7 billion cells per liter or lower. A count of 6.7 is considered to be in the upper range of normal, so what is ""normal"" may have to be redefined.
 Women with the highest counts had a 40 percent higher risk of nonfatal heart attack, 46 percent higher risk of stroke, and a 50 percent greater risk of death from all causes.
 These research results are independent of other risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, and lack of physical activity. Therefore, WBC count may identify people with a high probability of heart disease who show none of the more obvious risk factors.
 Relevance for men
 Asked if the same test would be as revealing for men, Manson answered, ""We have every reason to believe so. Some small studies have suggested a similar link in men. There probably will be other studies to look at this link in greater depth.""
 Manson also believes that white blood cell counts apply to younger as well as older women. ""They would apply, but women under 50 are less likely to have high counts,"" she says. ""That's because they are less likely to have been exposed to risk factors that raise the counts and eventually lead to hardening and blockage of their arteries.""
 Women (or men) can take steps to keep their counts down, simply by reducing or avoiding things that tend to raise them, such as smoking, high cholesterol levels, and being overweight, Manson says. ""We are also looking into the contribution of factors like high blood pressure and diabetes,"" she points out. ""Although all these risk factors correlate with high WBC counts, the two are independent so WBC levels can be elevated in the absence of traditional factors.""
 No new tests need to be developed, because blood-cell levels are now measured routinely in doctors' offices. The tests identify patients with infections or check for those at risk for infections, like cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. ""Physicians may want to look closer at WBC levels when obtaining the tests for other reasons,"" Manson notes. ""However, infections can cause a high white blood cell count that may make it appear that a patient is at high risk for heart disease when she is not. Therefore, routinely giving everyone the test to screen for heart disease is premature. More research needs to be done.""
 A companion test
 High WBC levels signal the presence of inflammation in blood vessels, which doctors believe is involved in hardening and clogging arteries. Someday, this test might be combined with measurement of C-reactive protein, another marker for inflammation. The Women's Health Initiative study included measurements of CRP, and it turned out to be almost as good a predictor of heart disease.
 ""Used together, the two can provide additive and powerful information about risk,"" Manson comments. Women who showed high levels of both inflammation markers had seven times the risk of heart disease as those with low levels.
 These results were published in the March 14 issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine. Besides Manson, the authors include Karen Margolis of the Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis and colleagues at participating medical facilities in several other states.
 Manson, who is also chief of the division of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, sums up their findings. ""WBC count appears to be a very promising way to identify people at increased risk of heart disease. At this point, it may add information that physicians can use when evaluating a patient's risk factors. With additional research, it may become one of the routine screening tests for heart disease.""

 Brief from the NBR Analysis Series
 Northeast Asia Turns Its Attention to the Arctic
 Linda Jakobson, Director of the East Asia Program at the Lowy Institute for International Policy, argues that the United States can both protect its interests in the Arctic and support permanent observer status for China, Japan, and South Korea. By backing their applications, Washington would give up little in the way of direct influence on Arctic matters, while benefiting from discussions with these countries to better understand their positions and intentions.
 China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ROK) have each applied to become a permanent observer on the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental forum established in 1996. Until the 21st century, the Arctic Council was mainly concerned with coordinating the protection of the environment and the rights of indigenous peoples. However, the council‚Äôs political significance has risen in tandem with the increasing pace of the melting of Arctic ice, and today it is regarded as the most influential international institution for developing Arctic governance and cooperation.
 All three countries have lobbied energetically for approval of their applications at the next ministerial meeting in May 2013. Yet, the inclusion of new permanent observers remains a contentious issue among the eight permanent members, which include the five Arctic littoral states (Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the United States) and the remaining Arctic circumpolar states (Finland, Iceland, and Sweden). At the two previous meetings in 2009 and 2011, ministers chose to defer a decision on new observers. Although in 2012 all the Nordic countries have expressed support for granting China, Japan, and the ROK permanent observer status, Canada, Russia, and the United States remain silent on the issue. The United States‚Äîalong with Canada and Russia‚Äîwould benefit from the inclusion of these countries as permanent observers and should back their applications at the next Arctic Council meeting.
 Growing Asian Interest in the Arctic
 China‚Äôs, Japan‚Äôs, and the ROK‚Äôs recent interest in the Arctic region is driven primarily by economic motives. In the coming decades, melting ice is expected to affect food production in Northeast Asia, while at the same time offering new opportunities for many shipping-related industries, fishing, and resource exploration. In addition, China views its participation in Arctic governance issues as a given based on its status as a rising global power. The ROK, in turn, views involvement in the Arctic as a means to boost its image as an emerging global player.
 Over the past five years, these Northeast Asian states have taken the following steps to protect what they perceive as their key interests in the Arctic:
 - Deepening their knowledge of climate change in order to be able to respond effectively to its effects on food production and extreme weather patterns
 - Securing access, at reasonable cost, to Arctic shipping routes when conditions permit regular commercial shipping in the summer
 - Strengthening their ability as non-Arctic states to access the region‚Äôs resources and fishing waters
 In pursuing these goals, China, Japan, and the ROK draw on strong polar scientific capabilities, which they have acquired over the past decades during their scientific polar research activities, primarily in the Antarctic. The Arctic remains a secondary focus for all three states, though the Arctic too has received increased funding in the past few years. China and the ROK conduct regular Arctic explorations on their own scientific icebreaker. China is building a second icebreaker, with Finnish expertise.
 China‚Äôs Interest Evokes Concern
 China‚Äôs Arctic aspirations, in particular, have evoked the same kind of concern, even anxiety, that throughout history has accompanied the rise of a large power. No one knows with certainty how China will use its power. The aggressive posture of China‚Äôs representative at the Arctic Council‚Äôs observers meeting in Stockholm in November 2012 only aggravated these concerns. Although Chinese officials have been cautious in their statements about the country‚Äôs interests in the Arctic‚Äîespecially in regard to resources‚Äîand have committed to respecting the sovereign rights of the Arctic states, they have also emphasized the need for Arctic states to respect the interests and rights of non-Arctic states.
 According to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which the United States has not ratified, all states have the right to exploit resources in international waters. However, China is worried that the area deemed to be international waters in the Arctic will shrink considerably if all the existing and anticipated claims by Arctic states on outer continental shelf extensions are deemed legal. Moreover, Beijing stresses that Arctic matters are global, not regional, because the changes taking place, particularly the melting of the polar ice cap, have a global impact. Chinese researchers now call China a ‚Äúnear-Arctic state‚Äù and an ‚ÄúArctic stakeholder,‚Äù underscoring its view that it should participate in discussions and decisions pertaining to the future of the Arctic.
 Permanent observer status would, at least in the short to medium term, not empower China, Japan, or the ROK in the Arctic Council because observers do not have the right to vote. But as permanent observers they would automatically be invited to Arctic Council activities and meetings, whereas they now have to await an invitation as ad hoc observers. In China‚Äôs case, one can surmise that Beijing wants to ensure a seat, even if only in the back row, partly because of concerns that at some point in the future it may not be a desired attendee and partly because of the hope‚Äîshared by both the ROK and Japan‚Äîthat observers could over time attain more influence.
 The United States can both protect its interests in the Arctic and support permanent observer status for China, Japan, and the ROK. By backing their applications, Washington would give up little in the way of direct influence on Arctic matters, while benefiting from substantial discussions with these countries to better understand their positions and intentions. Although China and the United States began to hold an annual dialogue on the law of the sea and polar issues in 2010, as a part of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, the Arctic remains a marginal issue in these discussions. Furthermore, engaging the three Northeast Asian states more deeply in Arctic Council activities will encourage them to pay serious attention to legitimate environmental concerns pertaining to shipping and resource exploration in the fragile Arctic environment.
 Linda Jakobson is Director of the East Asia Program at the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Sydney. She is the author (with Jingchao Peng) of China‚Äôs Arctic Aspirations, a policy paper published in November 2012 by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).
