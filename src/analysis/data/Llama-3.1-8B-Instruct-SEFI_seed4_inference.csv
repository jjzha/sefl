A new network diagram function has been added to Heurist that allows you to view the schema of relationships within the database, as well as the network of connections between the records in a search result set. It also allows export of network data to GEPHI for further manipulation.
The new tool is a good way for researchers to explore and understand their data structure and content visually. By dragging nodes into position and interactively modifying the shape and colours of the diagram elements, a researcher can sometimes reveal hidden properties and patterns or isolate anomalies within the data. Clicking on either the nodes or the lines pops up information on the connectivity between them (pointer fields, relationships, counts).
The Data Summary function uses a network diagram to display an interactive visualisation of the record relationships schema, that is the structure defined by pointer fields and relationships specified through relationship marker fields. These fields constrain the target record types and thus define the relationships structure of the database.
The Summary table on the left is a useful overview of the counts for each record type, and can be used to open a new tab with a search for a specific record type. Record types displayed in the network diagram can be turned on and off; the diagram remembers the selected record types and their position in the diagram between uses, so that the diagram is re-displayed the way you left it.
The direction of relationships between entities (record types) is shown with arrows, and the frequency of occurrence in the database is indicated by line thickness, which may be weighted to linear or log scales. The frequency of occurrence of each record type is shown by the radius of the node, which may also be linear or log scaled.
The nodes representing record types can be dragged to restructure the diagram; with gravity enabled, other nodes will settle into position.
Settings include line thickness, node radius and colours, and ‘gravity’ settings (which govern how the diagram behaves when entities are moved). There’s also a fisheye mode, mostly just for fun. Setting curved lines allows one to separately view relationships which go in opposite directions, which would otherwise appear as a single line with arrows in both directions.
You can view information about a particular record type (pointer and relationship marker fields, with use counts) by clicking on a node.
Network visualisation is also available through the “Connections” tab in the righthand panel of the search screen. This diagram shows the records in the current result-set as nodes, and the connections (pointer fields and relationships) as the lines between nodes (edges).
This diagram provides the same controls as the database schema diagram.
For both types of diagram you can export the data to a Gephi GEFX file via the Gephi button at top-right.
Gephi is a widely used free, open-source desktop tool that gives great flexibility in the visualisation of networks. Further information and download of Gephi is available here.
Once you have installed Gephi, clicking on the exported Gephi file will open the data in Gephi, where you have a wide range of options for tailoring and exporting similar diagrams. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Network Visualisation Assignment

Imagine you are a researcher studying a large dataset of book authors, publishers, and genres. Describe a scenario where using Heurist's network diagram function would help you discover hidden patterns or anomalies in the data, and how you would further explore these findings using Gephi.


### ANSWER:
Suppose I'm investigating the writing careers of mystery novel authors and their associated book genres, publishers, and collaborations. I apply Heurist's network diagram to search results for 'Mystery Authors.' On the diagram, I notice an unusual cluster of highly interconnected authors who published via a relatively unknown publishing house. Heurist also brings to my attention several anomalies relative to all the other authors in the set - specifically, only one author in the group produced 89% of their publications in the 1980s and an alarming number of book genres, especially given the short relative writing period of the group's originator. To understand this behavior, I utilize Gephi by exporting the findings to a GEFX file. With Gephi's refined manipulations, I determine that this publishing house focused on specific book genres in the 1980s and established strategic alliances with various authors. It could also show possible co-author collaborations that wouldn't be immediately visible otherwise. On the other hand, I incorrectly assume all publishing houses have no constraints on book genres, ignore turning on dragable node positions to show clearer groupings and ignore turning on dragable node positions to show clearer groupings, especially to highlight adamantly unique authors within this group turning on dragable node positions to show clearer groupings, especially to highlight adamantly unique authors turning on dragable node positions dragable node positions to show clearer groupings, especially to highlight adamantly unique authors within this group, especially.","### FEEDBACK:  Good start on applying Heurist's network diagram function to a research scenario, but there are areas for improvement.

You correctly identified a scenario where Heurist's network diagram function would help discover hidden patterns or anomalies in the data. However, you could have provided more details on how you would use the diagram to explore these findings.
You mentioned utilizing Gephi to further explore the findings, but you could have provided more specific examples of how you would use Gephi's features to refine the manipulations and gain a deeper understanding of the data.
You incorrectly assumed that all publishing houses have no constraints on book genres, which is not necessarily true. You should have considered the possibility that some publishing houses may have specific genre focuses or constraints.
You mentioned turning on dragable node positions to show clearer groupings, but you could have provided more details on how you would use this feature to highlight unique authors within the group."

Debunking Myths About Summer Camp
In This Article:
3. My child should attend sleepaway camp with a friend or a sibling.
Sending your child to camp with a buddy is a tricky decision, and you should weigh all facts carefully before coming to a conclusion. First, remember that what works for a friend or a sibling won't necessarily work for your child. When choosing a camp, keep your child's needs in mind and don't automatically assume that he will be happy where his friends are. Also, camp presents an entirely unknown social stratosphere. Old, familiar relationships may take on new characteristics within a fresh context, which can cause tension between friends. Consider also that your child may be ready to explore different elements of his character at camp. Perhaps he wishes to come out of his shell and try being friendly and outgoing, rather than the shy student he is at school. Surrounded by familiar faces, he may be bogged down by his customary role and feel unable to develop.
4. My special needs child has no camp options.
These days, camp is for everyone. Developmentally disabled children can choose from numerous options and enjoy a wonderful time at summer camp. Children with ADHD, dyslexia, learning disorders, and physical and mental handicaps can benefit from working with counselors who are trained to help them. Your child will welcome the opportunity to spend time with other children and participate in summer camp activities. Be sure to do detailed research on facilities and staff.
More on: Summer Camp \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Critically evaluate the claim that children should attend sleepaway camps with friends or siblings. Support your argument with theoretical perspectives and/ or practical examples. Examine the potential drawbacks of this approach, including impact on the childrens personal development, and compare/contrast how it harmonizes with/ or differentiates from benefits presented.

Research and gather academic evidence on the importance of independence in personal development theory
Using the text, identify an alternative approach that may help children discover new aspects of themselves
Consider an alternative setting where this alternative approach can benefit a child more
Create a conclusion summarizing your stance


### ANSWER:
Attending sleepaway camp with friends or siblings may hinder personal development as it could prevent children from gaining independence. According to Erik Erikson's psychosocial development theory, children need to establish their own identities (Erikson, 1963). Being surrounded by familiar faces can stifle this development. An alternative approach is to allow children to participate in activities freely, without influence from old relationships. This can help children discover new aspects of themselves. A setting such as a day camp with diverse activities and group rotations could benefit a child more than a sleepaway camp. Conclusion: It is generally not beneficial for children to attend sleepaway camp with friends or siblings. References: Erikson, Erik H. (1963). Childhood and society. New York: Norton & Company. ","### FEEDBACK:  Your argument is well-supported by Erik Erikson's psychosocial development theory, and you effectively highlight the potential drawbacks of attending sleepaway camp with friends or siblings. However, there are a couple of areas for improvement.

To strengthen your argument, consider incorporating additional theoretical perspectives, such as Jean Piaget's cognitive development theory or Urie Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of personal development in children.
When referencing Erik Erikson's work, ensure that you accurately attribute the specific theory or concept being referenced. In this case, you correctly referenced Erikson's psychosocial development theory, but it would be beneficial to provide more context or clarify which stage of the theory is most relevant to your argument."

Sepsis is the body’s overwhelming and life-threatening response to infection. It can lead to tissue damage, organ failure and death.
The source of infection could be from any number of causes, such as an animal bite, common cold that turns to pneumonia, open wound, urinary tract infection, an implanted device, stomach bug, post-surgery infection, meningitis, kidney infection, bacteria that enters the blood, to name a few.
What are the symptoms?
Symptoms include fever, chills or sweats, extreme body aches, confusion, shortness of breath and rapid heart rate.
If you or someone you know are experiencing these symptoms, call your doctor.
Go to the Emergency Department if:
- You feel sick, very tired, weak and achy
- Your heartbeat or breathing is very fast
- Temperature is above 101.5 or below 96.8
- Fingernails are pale or blue
- People say you aren’t making sense
- You have a wound that is painful, red, smells or has pus
“Do not wait to get treatment. Sepsis is a medical emergency,” said Kyirsten Amerine R.N., sepsis coordinator at Tucson Medical Center. “Time is everything in getting treated with the right antibiotics.” \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Design a Sepsis Awareness Campaign for a Local Hospital.

Based on the provided text, identify the most effective ways to convey the urgency and severity of sepsis symptoms to the general public for your campaign.
Explain how you plan to incorporate the message 'Time is everything in getting treated with the right antibiotics' into your campaign's messaging and visual elements.
Develop a concise slogan that captures the essence of your campaign's goals and effectively raises awareness about sepsis.


### ANSWER:
For task_1, I would suggest using a mix of print and social media advertising to convey the urgency and severity of sepsis symptoms. For example, 'Don't Wait, Act Fast' or 'Sepsis: Time is of the Essence' could be used as headlines in our campaign's print ads, while 'Sepsis: Know the Signs, Act Fast' could be used as a social media post. For task_2, I would incorporate the message into our campaign's visual elements, such as a countdown timer or a hourglass, to visually represent the urgency of seeking treatment for sepsis. For task_3, a potential slogan could be 'Beat the Clock, Beat Sepsis.'","### FEEDBACK:  Your campaign ideas show promise, but there are areas for improvement.

For task_1, consider adding more specific details on how you plan to use print and social media advertising, such as targeting specific demographics or using eye-catching visuals to grab attention.
For task_2, think about how you can make the message more relatable and personal, such as using a real-life story or testimonial to illustrate the importance of seeking treatment quickly.
For task_3, try to come up with a slogan that is more concise and memorable, such as 'Sepsis: Act Fast, Live Longer' or 'Don't Wait, Save a Life.'"

Recognizing Your Biases
In Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court held that segregation in public schools violated the Equal Protection Clause. Brown was a major blow to the separate but equal regime ratified by the Supreme Court’s decision in Plessy v. Ferguson. Brown is (rightfully) one of the most important constitutional cases ever decided, but it is still contested to this day whether Brown is consistent with the original understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment. Nonetheless, any legitimate theory of constitutional interpretation has to justify Brown, or it will not be taken seriously.
This is true for many of the decisions that we often view as ""progressive"" or that significantly changed the way in which society operates. In the years after Brown, various minorities groups turned to
the Court to effectuate broad changes in society. Civil rights, women’s rights, fairness in the
criminal justice system – the Warren Court, in particular, remade the landscape of America in a series of decisions in the 1950s and 1960s. As an African-American and a woman, I am especially proud of what they accomplished, but for constitutional law theorists, it is often difficult to justify many of these decisions as consistent with the ""original"" understanding of the Constitution or the Court's decision to intervene as consistent with the constitutional text and structure. Some scholars have been successful (in my view), but we still argue over these issues in the legal scholarship.
Despite my pride in certain Warren Court decisions, I have to be honest and admit that when I teach cases like Plessy v. Ferguson or the Civil Rights Cases or Parents Involved or Washington v. Davis, I question whether it is wise to give courts the ability to ""remake"" the landscape of America. Talk about outcome oriented expedient, right? Not surprisingly, like most people (though they won’t admit it), I only like the Court to intervene when it furthers something I believe in. But I find this view to be problematic for a legal scholar, and as a result, I go to great lengths when I am writing to try to neutralize this bias.
Indeed, my scholarship is my attempt to overcome this weakness and be as intellectual honest as I can. Sometimes, the result is that I make ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" arguments, but at the end of the day, it is my honest assessment of what I think the constitutional text and structure require rather than advocating for judicial intervention to achieve my desired outcome. Plessy and cases like it make me realize that the Court does not always get it right, and sometimes, because of the limitations of its power, cannot get it “right” (see Giles v. Harris as a particularly egregious example). The problem for me and my particular bias is that, if one is intellectually honest, you have to take the good with the bad. Take the Plessy with the Brown, so to speak. This does not mean that I have to believe Plessy was decided correctly; rather, in advocating for judicial intervention, one has to recognize that sometimes you might get a Plessy. Other times, you might get a Brown but you have to believe that judicial intervention is justified in both instances (Lochner and Roe is another tough one).
But the risk of a Plessy makes me wonder why we, as a society, are comfortable with the idea of the Supreme Court as being the change agent and in the process, promoting judicial intervention in lieu of the political process. I am always taken back by how pro-Court my students are. After teaching constitutional law for almost four years, it is not immediately obvious to me that this is right - that the Court, rather than the political process, should be the one to effectuate change. And that is why, in my scholarship, I focus on the constitutional text and the structure so I won’t have to decide if this is right (because I fear that my answer might be “yes, it is right if I like the outcome”). I recognize that the text and structure will only get us so far in deciding tough questions, but I leave it to others braver than I to formulate theories of constitutional interpretation to fill in the gaps.

Justice Souter in his Harvard speech had a realistic take of Plessy being a not overly egregious ruling in respect to the times. By now, we accept the courts to have a role in public policy matters up to a point, and it is a fact of life. It is best more of a ""nudge"" with certain moments when it is more. I respect your attempt at neutrality. As to Lochner, note even Justice Harlan -- who wrote or joined some ""Lochner-like"" opinions such as to yellow dog contracts -- dissented. There is a reason why it is seen as a symbolic bridge too far.

Bias is various forms is with all of us. Bias is not evil most of the time. Hans Georg Gadamer's ""Truth and Method"" impressed me very much, especially with discussion of the Hermeneutical Circle that some, perhaps many, of us use in the process of decision making. The Hermeneutical approach to interpretation/construction of ancient texts can be applied to our not so ancient Constitution.
I recently read and was impressed with Stephen M. Griffin's ""Book Review Colloquy: How Do We Redeem the Time?"" reviewing Jack Balkin's two recent (2011) books ""Constitutional Redemption: Political Faith In An Unjust World"" and ""Living Originalism."" It is available at SSRN:
The Holy Grail of Constitutional Interpretation/Construction remains to be discovered, assuming it exists. In the meantime, I take comfort in the ""Horseshoes Theory"": close enough counts, as least for the time being. But the word ""Justice"" serves as conscience.

Talking about bias, I just skimmed ""The Oath,"" the recent book on the Supreme Court and the chapter on Sotomayor's nomination comes to mind. In effect, it suggests Sotomayor's infamous ""wise Latina"" speech addressed the reality that everyone has some sort of ""bias"" though it not a comfortable thing to accept (the critics had their own biases all the same). Humans have biases, they are 'partial,' though they are cabined in various ways, including when interpreting law. It also helps to have multimember courts (or academies) where things hopefully balance out some.
Posted by: Joe | Nov 9, 2012 9:55:28 AM
I agree with you Franita. The problem is that the legislature has passed laws that are biased and invidiously discriminatory on their face.
Would you support a Constitutional Amendment that strictly prohibited the mention of sex, age, race, national origin, marital status, breeding status, etc., in any law of the land?
As it is, our laws are rife with sex preferences that generally favor women. With age preferences that deny the vote or choice of sex partner to minors. With marital- and family-status preferences that severely punish folks for being non-married or non-breeders. With funding rules for national parks and forests that Amerikans of color don't visit and for public schools that can't begin to educate them.
If the country were run by Walmart, apart from equal access to great products, low prices and full employment, we'd have a place where gays and straights, marrieds and singles, Blacks and Whites, breeders and non-breeders, young and old, citizens and non-citizens, atheists and Romanists, would be treated equally once inside the door.

Consider the role of the Supreme Court in shaping public policy. Write a short essay evaluating the impact of significant court decisions, such as Brown v. Board of Education and Plessy v. Ferguson, in terms of their consistency with the original understanding of the Constitution and their effects on society.

Identify and describe the significance of at least two landmark cases and their outcomes.
Discuss whether the Supreme Court should be seen as the primary change agent in society, and consider arguments for and against its role in shaping public policy.


### ANSWER:
In evaluating the impact of significant Supreme Court decisions, such as Brown v. Board of Education and Plessy v. Ferguson, it is crucial to consider their consistency with the original understanding of the Constitution and their effects on society. Brown v. Board of Education, which declared segregation in public schools unconstitutional, is often viewed as a progressive decision that significantly advanced civil rights. In contrast, Plessy v. Ferguson, which upheld segregation, is widely regarded as a setback for equality. The outcomes of these cases demonstrate the Supreme Court's substantial influence on shaping public policy and society. ","### FEEDBACK:  The essay provides a good starting point for evaluating the impact of significant Supreme Court decisions, but it can be improved by addressing the following areas.

To strengthen the essay, consider adding more depth to the discussion of the original understanding of the Constitution and how it relates to the decisions in Brown v. Board of Education and Plessy v. Ferguson.
To provide a more comprehensive evaluation, include a clear thesis statement that outlines the main arguments and sets the tone for the rest of the essay."

What should we eat?
Meals and snacks made from whole-food ingredients packed with energy and nutrition — whenever we’re hungry.
Doesn’t sound so confusing. Yet eating well and getting proper nutrition can seem exceedingly difficult — so much so that obesity is an epidemic; American girls as young as 7 report being on diets; and weight loss is a multibillion-dollar industry. Why? The seemingly simple ways of eating well are obscured by a number of factors: Marketing, convenience, misinformation, stress and boredom, just to name a few.
We eat for many reasons — because we are truly hungry, yes, but also because someone cooked for us, or because it’s noon, or because we’re bored…or simply because food is there.
It can also be hard to know which foods to eat. Sometimes our bodies crave foods we know aren’t good for us. Sometimes we don’t feel good, and we don’t know if food is the culprit. Sometimes we read conflicting information about what foods may or may not benefit us, or trigger inflammation, or lead to weight gain. And often, we eat foods that are not ultimately nourishing simply because they deliver fast energy.
For all of these reasons and more, getting into a positive rhythm of eating can seem challenging. But honestly, getting there is the only hard part. When we tune in to our bodies and figure out the real food rules that work best for us as individuals, we look and feel our best. Then we can rely on our bodies to know instinctively what to eat, when, how, where and how much.
Barring medical conditions that can’t be improved through diet, the food we eat is truly our greatest ally in achieving optimum health. According to Samantha Durland, a physician who specializes in women’s health in Lawrence, Kansas, “At least 80 percent of how you look and feel comes directly from your diet.”
Step 1: Get Educated
Eating a well-rounded diet made up of a variety of whole foods and focused on eating lots of plants, plenty of high-quality protein, and satiating, healthy fats helps ensure we feel satisfied and energized all day. Many times food cravings indicate either we are dehydrated, in need of sleep or are eating for a non-hunger-related reason. Eat plenty of healthful foods, and we often find food cravings diminish or disappear.
What to Eat: Respected food writer Michael Pollan said it best in his best-seller, Food Rules: “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.” “Eat food” means real, whole foods made from real food ingredients. “Not too much” means eating when we are hungry and stopping when we no longer feel hungry (as opposed to when we feel full). And “mostly plants” is self-explanatory. Although there are many valid styles of healthful eating, one thing all healthy diets have in common is plenty of leaves, roots, fruits, nuts, seeds, legumes and whole grains.
When to Eat: Although advice on this topic abounds, the most recent research suggests that when we eat is far less important than what we eat. Experiment to see what eating schedule works best for you. Holistic nutritionist Stephanie Small emphasizes the importance of paying attention to your body. “Through a period of trial and error — trying out what’s been shown to work well, and then checking in with your body, energy level and even emotions to see if that works for you,” she says, “you can identify the eating schedule that suits your needs.”
In the end, the schedule that makes you feel your best, provides sustained energy throughout the day and sets you up for a restful sleep is the right one for you. It will deliver the nutrients your brain and body need to perform their numerous functions, including detoxification, which is something our bodies usually know how to do all by themselves when we take care of ourselves well. The importance of keeping our bodies consistently nourished and blood sugar stable must not be underestimated. When we consume simple, processed carbohydrates, the glucose signals our bodies to release insulin to manage it. A fast drop in blood sugar follows that and leaves us hungry again. If we eat more processed carbs with lots of glucose, this roller coaster just keeps going. Eventually, our cells can become resistant to insulin, leading to myriad illnesses with severe consequences. Regularly eating plenty of protein, fiber and healthy fats; getting enough sleep; managing stress — these healthy habits all contribute to stabilizing blood sugar.
Curious About the Benefits of Fasting?
Various types of fasting are practiced all over the world. Besides the cultural importance of certain fasts, modern science tells us that the practice does have practical benefits. Fasting can reduce inflammation, improve energy and boost metabolism. For many people, keeping blood sugar steady is too important to allow for intense periods of fasting, but we can still get some of these health benefits, physician and herbalist Aviva Romm says. Simply stop eating each evening in enough time to allow for at least 10 hours of fasting. For example, if you stop eating at 7:30 p.m., go to bed around 11, wake around 6:30 a.m. and then eat breakfast at 7:30, you will have fasted for 12 hours.
If you have time to get a little bit of exercise before breakfast, so much the better, based on recent research published in the Journal of Physiology. The study compared three groups of men who ate a high-calorie, high-fat diet for six weeks and either exercised before breakfast, exercised after eating a carbohydrate-rich meal, or did not exercise at all. The only group that gained no weight and showed no signs of insulin resistance was the group that exercised in the fasted state. But don’t forget to enjoy a big glass of warm water before that run!
Step 2: Get Ready
Not being prepared to eat well is a quick way to sabotage our best intentions. When we’re running late and don’t have something nutritious ready to put on the table, it’s tempting to grab fast food or order a pizza.
Prepare the kitchen: The easiest way not to eat junk food is not to have junk food on hand. Get rid of all the junk food in your house — excessively processed foods, sugary foods, salty fried foods,
foods made from refined white flour, and any foods you know you don’t tolerate well.
Stock the pantry: Consider what you eat and when: Do you always want a snack in the late afternoon? Plan what you are going to eat and stock your pantry accordingly. When we buy apples and peanut butter, we eat apples and peanut butter. When we buy potato chips, we eat potato chips. Keep a healthy snack stash in the car, office and anywhere else you find yourself hungry without a good food option. Think of (or look online, in books or in magazines) fast, simple recipes with ingredients easy to stock for emergency dinner situations. It can also be useful to develop a system to keep track of what you have. Tools like the Evernote app (for iOs and Android) allow you to keep reminders about groceries that you can check when you’re at the market.
Anna Thomas, author of the influential 1972 cookbook The Vegetarian Epicure and the more recent, award-winning Love Soup, says people have often asked her what they can do to improve their cooking. “Improve your shopping,” she says. “If you start with something good, you will likely finish with something good, perhaps even great. But no amount of skill or fussing can overcome poor ingredients. Start with the best ingredients you can get, and treat them with respect. Your cooking will improve at once.”
Develop systems: Grocery shopping routines help make eating well a habit that’s easy to maintain. Shopping on Saturdays, prepping food on Sundays and cooking quick, simple meals on weekdays works well for many people. Get in the habit of washing and chopping vegetables as soon as they come into the house so they’ll be convenient to use when you need them. Make a big pot of quinoa or garbanzo beans that you can use in different ways throughout the week. Try recipes that make great leftovers for the freezer. Create a meal plan that is easy to follow. For example, roast a chicken or filet of salmon every week, sitting atop different seasonal vegetables, and flavor this one-pot meal with different herbs and spices each time. Make every Friday Mexican night. Or find one great seasonal cookbook, and cook through it for a whole week, month or season.
Another strategy for simplification is sticking to one culinary tradition. Do as food writer Eugenia Bone does, and focus on cooking recipes of one cuisine, such as Italian or Greek, for a while. It’ll be easy to stock your pantry appropriately, and you’ll learn a tradition intimately. She can also help you strategically cook throughout the year through her Kitchen Ecosystem project (kitchenecosystem.com).
The Restaurant Risk
Reviews of studies conducted over several years confirm the relationship between eating at restaurants and weight gain, high body mass index, high bad cholesterol and low good cholesterol. According to physician, herbalist and midwife Aviva Romm, eating only one meal out each week translates to a two-pound weight gain every year. We simply don’t have enough control over what goes into our bodies when someone else prepares it. Of course, some restaurants are much better than others when it comes to using fresh, whole food ingredients. Eating highly processed foods made with inferior ingredients — such as fast food or food from most chain restaurants — is never good for our health. But even restaurants with healthier options generally include more processed ingredients, excess sodium, unhealthy fats and added sugars than we would ever use in home-cooked meals. When we’re working to establish good eating habits, it’s easiest if we eat most meals at home. Then when we’ve achieved a healthy baseline, we’ll be better prepared to choose wisely in restaurants — and to know when to splurge.
Step 3: Pay Attention
As we endeavor to discover and establish our own best eating habits and routines, our first task is simply to pay attention to what we eat and how it makes us feel.
Keep a food journal: This is the best way to pay more attention to what we eat and how it affects us. Don’t count calories or obsess over every detail — you don’t even have to keep the journal for very long. But journaling is an excellent way to bring greater awareness to each food choice. Users often report its ability to positively affect food choices before eating. And many studies show that keeping a food diary is directly linked with successful weight loss. To try it, keep track of what you eat and when, and note how you respond — mentally, physically and emotionally. Journaling can help clarify our eating patterns. Use a simple tally at the end of each day to note how many plants you ate: Was it the recommended seven to nine servings? Take note of how many sugary foods you ate: Did it add up to more than you thought? Did you feel energized afterward, or happy or guilty? Besides helping us figure out certain foods or patterns of eating that might not work well for us, journaling increases awareness of what and how much we consume.
Eat mindfully: Awareness of what we eat leads directly into more mindful eating. A growing body of research links mindless, distracted eating with stress, anxiety and overeating. Practicing mindful eating, on the other hand, is about slowing down to become aware of all of our senses in the present moment in response to food, and tuning in nonjudgmentally to feelings of hunger, satiety and discomfort. It’s one of the most powerful ways we can learn how to nourish ourselves. We can start by taking a moment for gratitude before eating and asking ourselves simple questions whenever we eat something: Am I really hungry for this? How will this likely make me feel? Is there something I need more right now? (We’ll cover mindful eating in more depth in our next issue.)
Step 4: Reflect
After we’ve learned to pay more attention to our food choices, it often becomes clear what’s been working and what hasn’t. If you’ve uncovered habits that are hindering your healthy eating goals, identify them and work to change them.
According to Charles Duhigg, author of The Power of Habit, every habit consists of three parts: a cue, a routine and a reward. To create a new food habit, we must address all three components. Perhaps the cue to start eating fruit instead of sugar in the afternoon could be a phone alarm that reminds you every afternoon at 2 to get a piece of fruit. The routine is to eat the fruit. The reward could be as simple as adding a checkmark to a calendar or enjoying a small piece of dark chocolate afterward. Even if this seems counterintuitive, he says, our bodies eventually let go of the need for the chocolate and simply associate eating the fruit with the feeling of reward.
Keep in mind that our taste buds may have become accustomed to sugary, salty, greasy and artificial flavors, and that we can change what our taste buds enjoy. For example, many people discover that, after reducing or eliminating refined sugar, they find sugary items to taste overly sweet. It also takes time to recalibrate if we are addicted to sugar and caffeine, but it is possible. Be patient with yourself. According to physician and herbalist Aviva Romm, thousands of her patients have reported that it took them about five to seven days for their taste buds to unlearn old habits. It doesn’t have to be all about restriction, either. Look for herbs, spices and other new, healthy ingredients to try for flavor and variety.
If dietary changes produce unpleasant physical symptoms (fatigue, anxiety, irritability, constipation, sleeplessness, etc.), a dietary trigger could be to blame. Journaling and eating more mindfully can give us a hint of these triggers. But if that doesn’t prove to be enough, an elimination diet — in which we systematically remove and then reintroduce certain foods — may be helpful. Romm outlines a four-week program specifically tailored to women who feel chronically exhausted in her book, The Adrenal Thyroid Revolution. She helps readers create the diet most right for them by removing unhealthy or problematic foods, and then replacing them with foods and nutrients that activate the body’s ability to repair itself. “Your body is genius at moving you toward health; you just need help clearing out what’s getting in the way of what your body knows how to do,” she says.
Step 5: Now, Eat for Pleasure
We don’t have to journal, breathe and pause, reflect, eat all our meals at home and never have anything sweet for all time. Do not focus on calories. Do not focus on macronutrients. Focus on eating real, whole foods that come from nature, and on paying attention to how your own mind and body react to the foods you eat. Learning to eat well is about establishing a baseline that we can return to, setting us up for a lifetime of health and wellness. Once we’ve given our bodies a chance to experience it, it’s not difficult to continue eating this way, which means we can focus strictly on enjoying food.

“Caleb’s Crossing” by Geraldine Brooks FIC BROO (also LARGE PRINT, PLAYAWAY)
“Caleb’s Crossing” is based on the true story of the son of a Wampanoag chieftain in 1660s Massachusetts who became the first Native American to graduate from Harvard College. So if you like historical fiction, this would suit you well. The first-person narrator is Bethia Mayfield, daughter of a Calvinist minister. She and Caleb meet when they are 12 and become lifelong friends. Life is hard in Puritan New England, however, and the colonists are bringing rapid and extensive (often devastating) changes to the lives of the native population. Caleb is one of those curious and intelligent individuals who tries to act as a bridge between the two cultures to the benefit of both. Bethia is also quite curious and intelligent. Being a woman, though, she has to learn the hard way to keep silent most of the time.
The dialogue between Caleb and Bethia is delightfully thought-provoking as they question each other’s way of life from farming and hunting to medicine and spirituality. And I do appreciate the various possibilities for the meaning of “crossing” in the title.
Some critics have thought Bethia is too much of a feminist and too modern in tone, but the author stated in an interview that she can prove that women like Bethia did exist by citing the transcripts of court records. Most women did not learn to write and so there are few diaries or letters written by women from that period. Court transcripts were one of the few places where women actually had a written voice–and it was often a feisty one. Quiet women did not end up in court. Women accused of being witches and scolds did.
It was a great pleasure to attend Geraldine Brooks’s presentation last fall as part of the QC Women’s Connection International Women Authors series. One of the things I remember particularly is her saying she doesn’t believe in writer’s block because though “writing may aspire to be art, it starts out as craft.” Other professions–she suggested hairdressers or proctologists–don’t have blocks. “Words are stones–the book is the wall.” Every day before she begins writing, she takes a poetry anthology and lets it fall open. She reads that poem and that “primes her pump”.
Other historical novels by Brooks you might like are “March” about the father of Louisa May Alcott’s “Little Women” during the Civil War; “Year of Wonders” about a village in England which quarantines itself in the Plague year of 1666; or “People of the Book” about an ancient Jewish tome and all its owners through the years until modern times.

Analyze the symbolism and significance of the title 'Caleb's Crossing' in the context of the novel.

Discuss the various meanings of 'crossing' as they relate to Caleb's experiences and relationships throughout the novel.
Examine the implications of Bethia's 'crossing' into the world of knowledge and ideas, despite societal expectations of her role as a woman in 17th-century Puritan society.


### ANSWER:
The title 'Caleb's Crossing' is rich in symbolism, representing both literal and figurative crossings in the novel. On one hand, 'crossing' refers to Caleb's journey from his Wampanoag culture to the world of 17th-century Puritan society, where he becomes the first Native American to graduate from Harvard College. On the other hand, it signifies his bridging of the two cultures, as he navigates the complexities of colonialism and attempts to find common ground between his people and the English colonizers. Additionally, 'crossing' can be seen as a metaphor for Bethia's own journey, as she 'crosses' into the world of knowledge and ideas, defying societal expectations of her role as a woman in Puritan society.","### FEEDBACK:  The analysis provides a good starting point for understanding the symbolism of the title 'Caleb's Crossing'. However, to strengthen the argument, consider incorporating more textual evidence to support the claims made about Caleb's and Bethia's journeys. Additionally, explore the implications of the title's multiple meanings and how they intersect and conflict with one another.

To address the first error, consider adding specific quotes or scenes from the novel that illustrate Caleb's and Bethia's experiences with 'crossing'. This will help to build a more convincing case for the title's symbolism.
To address the second error, consider delving deeper into the ways in which the title's multiple meanings intersect and conflict with one another. For example, how does Caleb's literal crossing of the cultural divide intersect with Bethia's figurative crossing into the world of knowledge? How do these different meanings of 'crossing' reinforce or challenge one another?"

Watching a toddler's bad habits can make any parent cringe, from the crunch as a child bites his nails to the aggravation of watching your daughter pick her nose. While some habits are completely harmless, others can increase your child's risk of getting an infection. Pick your battles, Mom and Dad -- scolding your child about all of his bad habits can be overwhelming. You might also want to take a look at yourself -- did Junior learn to pick his nose from Dad? Changing your bad habits can set a positive example for your tots.
Pay attention to all of your tot's bad habits. As annoying or aggravating as these habits may be, children typically grow out of most bad habits within a few months. If habits persist, hold back on scolding your child for picking his nose, ears or scabs. Punishment is not an effective way of discouraging undesirable behavior.
Offer alternative behaviors to your tot. If he is picking his nose, offer him a tissue or give him something else to do with his hands. Children often pick up bad habits through observation or as a way to relieve stress and boredom. Finding something to keep him occupied can help him learn a new method to cope with his feelings.
Work on one bad habit at a time. Trying to change multiple bad habits at once can cause children to become anxious, fearful or overwhelmed. Pick one at a time and remain consistent -- every time you see the tot engaging in a bad habit, offer alternatives.
Encourage your child when you see him engaging in alternatives to bad habits. If he is petting the cat instead of sucking on his fingers, say, ""It is so great that you are petting the cat!"" This can encourage him to continue positive habits without your guidance in the future. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Analyzing Habits in Children

After reading the provided passage, design a hypothetical ""Habit Tracker"" mobile application for parents to monitor and modify their child's detrimental habits. Describe the core features of your application in 250 words or less, ensuring that every characteristic aligns with the guidance offered in the passage.


### ANSWER:
The Habit Tracker app is designed to help parents monitor and change their child's detrimental habits. Core features include a habit catalog where parents can log and identify their child's habits, categorizing them as either positive or negative. The app includes a personalized habit plan, enabling parents to set goals and develop tailored strategies for eliminating negative habits. A reward system is also integrated, allowing parents to offer incentives when their child exhibits positive behavior. The app will also include a stress and boredom tracker to help identify triggers for undesirable habits. Additionally, a community forum will be included for parents to share and discuss their experiences with other parents. The Habit Tracker app will prioritize alternative behaviors, encouraging parents to offer engaging alternatives to bad habits. Real-time notifications remind parents to praise and acknowledge their child when they display alternative positive behaviors.","### FEEDBACK:  The Habit Tracker app is a good start, but it needs more refinement to effectively track and modify children's detrimental habits.

The app's features are not clearly aligned with the guidance offered in the passage. For example, the passage emphasizes the importance of not scolding children for their bad habits, but the app's reward system may inadvertently encourage scolding when the child does not meet the expected positive behavior.
The app's features are not well-integrated to provide a comprehensive solution. For instance, the stress and boredom tracker is a good idea, but it is not clear how it will be used to develop tailored strategies for eliminating negative habits."

The idea that you can predict the climate based on it's temperature behaviour between 1970 and 1998 is silly. Just as the statement that the absence of warming since 1998 and 2011 cannot utterly disproove AGW the rise between 1970 and 1998 cannot 100% proove the theory that CO2 is a significant greenhouse gas at the levels we have today.
Nobody is trying to predict temperatures based on historically temperatures over the last 40 or so. The predictions are based on our understanding of earth's climate over hundreds of millions of years and particularly the last 4 million years of recurring ice ages. The climate while complicated has to obey some very simple basic physical rules that is the energy coming in has over time to equal the energy going out. Change that simple relationship in some way and the temperature will change change until such time as the equation is back in balance. It is certain that greenhouse gases reduce the amount of energy that leaves the earth.
Northern Europe is having a wet and cool summer, it's just America which is having a long, hot and dry one.
No my original statement is correct
According to NOAA:-http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/2012/6
The Northern Hemisphere land and ocean average surface temperature for June 2012 was the all-time warmest June on record, at 1.30°C (2.34°F) above average.
The Northern Hemisphere average land temperature, where the majority of Earth's land is located, was record warmest for June. This makes three months in a row — April, May, and June — in which record-high monthly land temperature records were set. Most areas experienced much higher-than-average monthly temperatures, including most of North America and Eurasia, and northern Africa. Only northern and western Europe, and the northwestern United States were notably cooler than average.

When thinking about such climatic events it is vital to have a sense of proportion and not see a tiny change over 3 decades as a reason to think that there will be a drastic ""exponential"" continuation of this.
The temperatures changes over the last 3 decades simply confirms our basic understanding of the climate.
It is akin to having a graph of the speed of your car traveling along a highway. When the speed is 55mph your pasenger is happy, when the graph plots up to 57 mph the pasenger panics because the car is about to accelerate untill the machine disintergrates at the sound barrier.

Assessing Climate Change Predictions

Using the analogies provided by Tim the Plumber (the car's speed graph and cruise control), think of another everyday scenario that can illustrate the relationship between human activities and climate change. Explain your chosen analogy in 100-150 words, and discuss how it can help or hinder our understanding of the issue.


### ANSWER:
A suitable analogy for the relationship between human activities and climate change is the concept of overspending money. Imagine a checking account where income represents natural resources like forests and fossil fuels, while expenses represent human consumption and emissions. The account balance represents the state of the environment. Just as exceeding income with expenses leads to debt, exceeding the planet's capacity to absorb emissions leads to climate change. This analogy can help people understand the consequences of unsustainable resource use and encourage personal responsibility. However, it may hinder our understanding by oversimplifying the complexities of climate change and underestimating the scale of the problem.","### FEEDBACK:  The analogy of overspending money is a good start, but it needs refinement to accurately represent the relationship between human activities and climate change. Consider revising the analogy to account for the non-linear effects of emissions on the environment, such as the tipping points and feedback loops that can lead to abrupt and irreversible changes. Additionally, think about how to incorporate the concept of planetary boundaries, which represent the safe operating space for human activities within the Earth's systems. By revising the analogy to include these complexities, you can create a more nuanced and accurate representation of the issue.

The analogy could be improved by considering the concept of planetary boundaries and the non-linear effects of emissions on the environment.
The analogy could be further developed by exploring the implications of exceeding planetary boundaries and the potential consequences for the environment and human societies."

Nutrition and weight management before and during pregnancy has a profound effect on the development of infants. This is a rather critical time for healthy fetal development as infants rely heavily on maternal stores and nutrient for optimal growth and health outcome later in life. Prenatal nutrition addresses nutrient recommendations before and during pregnancy. Prenatal nutrition has a strong influence on birth weight and further development of the infant.
A common saying that 'a woman is eating for two while pregnant' implies that a mother should consume twice as much during pregnancy. However, in reality this is not true. Although maternal consumption will directly affect both herself and the growing fetus, over eating excessively will compromise the baby's health as the infant will have to work extra hard to become healthy in the future. Compared with the infant, the mother possesses the least biological risk. Therefore, excessive calories, rather than going to the infant, often get stored as fat in the mother. On the other hand, insufficient consumption will result in lower birth weight.
Maintaining a healthy weight during gestation lowers adverse risks on infants such as birth defects, as well as chronic conditions in adulthood such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Ideally, the rate of weight gain should be monitored during pregnancy to support the most ideal infant development.

The ""Barker Hypothesis"", or Thrifty phenotype, states that conditions during pregnancy will have long term effects on adult health. Associated risk of lifelong diseases includes cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Babies born lighter in weight appear to have an increased rate of mortality than babies born at a heavier weight. This does not mean that heavy babies are less of a concern. Death rate would rise as birth weight increases beyond normal birth weight range. Therefore, it is important to maintain a healthy gestational weight gain throughout pregnancy for achieving the optimal infant birth weight.
When this theory was first proposed, it was not well accepted and was met with much skepticism. The main criticism was that confounding variables such as environmental factors could attribute to many of the chronic diseases such that low birth weight alone should not be dictated as an independent risk factor. Subsequent research studies supporting the theory attempted to adjust these environmental factors and in turn, provided more convincing results with minimal confounding variables.
""Barker's Hypothesis"" is also known as “Fetal Programming Hypothesis”. The word “programming” illustrates the idea that during critical periods in early fetal development, there are persisting changes in the body structure and function that are caused by environmental stimuli. This relates to the concept of developmental plasticity where our genes can express different ranges of physiological or morphological states in response to the environmental conditions during fetal development.
If the mother has an inadequate diet then it signals the baby that the living condition in the long term will be impoverished. Consequently the baby adapts by changing its body size and metabolism to prepare for harsh conditions of food shortages after birth. Physiological and metabolic processes in the body undergo long term changes as a result of restricted growth. When the living environment switches from the condition of malnutrition to a society of abundant supply of nutrients, this exposes the baby to a bountiful environment that goes against what its body is designed for and this places the baby at a higher risk of adult diseases later in adulthood. By the same token, if the fetus growing in the womb of a healthy mother is exposed to prolonged famine after birth, the infant would be less adaptive to the harsh environment than low birth weight babies.
The Dutch Famine
Since small birth weight is associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases in later life, and poor maternal nutrition during gestation contributes to restricted fetal development, maternal malnutrition may be a cause of increased disease susceptibility in adulthood.
The Dutch famine of 1944 or the 'Hunger Winter' during World War II serves as an epidemiological study that is used to examine the effects of maternal under-nutrition during different gestational stages. The famine was a period (roughly five to six months) of extreme food shortage in the west of Netherlands. The famine was imposed on a previously well-nourished population and the official daily ration for the general adult population gradually decreased from 1800 calories in December 1943 to 1400 calories in October 1944 to below 1000 calories in the late November 1944. December 1944 to April 1945 was the peak of the famine where the official daily ration fell abruptly to about 400~800 calories. Even though pregnant and lactating women had extra food during the famine, these extra supplies could no longer be provided at the height of the famine. In the early May 1945, the liberation of the Netherlands restored the food supply. The daily ration had increased to more than 2000 calories in June 1945. What is unique about Dutch Famine as an experimental study on the effects of maternal malnutrition is that the population was strictly circumscribed in time and place and the sudden onset and relief of the famine was imposed on a previously well-nourished population.
The Dutch Famine during World War II had a profound effect on the health condition of the general public, especially women who conceived during the period of time. The period of maternal starvation is shown to have limited intrauterine growth and has been identified as one of the most important contributor to coronary heart disease as well as other chronic diseases later in life. These findings agree well with Barker’s hypothesis; it supports the theory that maternal under-nutrition leads to a lower birth weight due to restricted intrauterine development and ultimately leads to higher risks of chronic conditions in adult life.
Recommendations for Pregnant Women
Gestation is the period of embryo development from conception to birth. Gestation is about 40 weeks in humans and is divided into three trimesters, each spanning 3 months. Gestational stages, on the other hand, are based on physiological fetal development, which include blastogenesis, embryonic stage and fetal stage.
Blastogenesis is the stage from fertilization to about 2 weeks. The fertilized egg or the zygote becomes a blastocyst where the outer layer and the inner cell mass differentiate to form placenta and the fetus respectively. Implantation occurs at this stage where the blastocyst becomes buried in the endometrium.
Embryonic stage is approximately from 2 weeks to 8 weeks. It is also in this stage where the blastocyst develops into an embryo, where all major features of human are present and operational by the end of this stage.
Pre-pregnancy weight and gestational weight gain
The pattern and amount of weight gain is closely associated with gestational stages. Additional energy is required during pregnancy due to the expansion of maternal tissues and stores in order to support fetal development.
In the first trimester (blastogenesis and early embryonic stages), the mother experiences a minimal weight gain (approximately 0.5-2 kilograms), while the embryo weighs only 6 grams, which is approximately the weight 6 raisins.
In the second trimester and third trimester (late embryonic and fetal stages), the fetus undergoes rapid weight growth and the weight increases to about 3000~4000 grams. It is also in this period that the mother experiences the bulk of her gestational weight gain but the amount of weight gain varies greatly. The amount of weight gain depends strongly on their pre-pregnant weight.
Generally, a normal weight is strongly recommended for mothers when entering gestation, as it promotes overall health of infants. Maternal body weight is determined by the Body Mass Index (BMI) which is defined as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters. While pregnant, body weight should be managed within the recommended gestational weight gain range as it is shown to have a positive effect on pregnancy outcomes. Gestational weight gain should also be progressive and the recommended weight depends on pre-pregnant body weight.
Since the total weight gain depends on pre-pregnant body weight, it is recommended that underweight women should undergo a larger weight gain for healthy pregnancy outcomes, and overweight or obese women should undergo a smaller weight gain.
Normal Weight Women
Women having a BMI of 18.5~24.9 are classified as having a normal or healthy body weight. This group have the lowest risk of adverse birth outcomes. Their babies are least likely to either be low-birth weight or high-birth weight. It is advised that women with a normal weight before pregnancy should gain a total of 11.5 kilograms to 16.0 kilograms throughout gestation, which is approximately 0.4 kilogram per week in the second and third trimesters.
In order to maintain a steady weight gain, the mother should engage in mild physical activities. Participating in aerobic activities such as walking and swimming 3 to 4 times a week is usually adequate. Vigorous physical activity is not recommended since an excessive loss of calories is induced which is not sufficient to support fetal development.
A proper diet is also essential to healthy weight gain. The common saying “a woman is eating for two” often leads to mothers thinking that they should eat twice as much. In reality, only a small increase in caloric intake is needed to provide for the fetus; approximately 350 calories more in the second trimester and 450 calories more in the third trimester. Also, healthy choices should be emphasized for these extra calories such as whole grain products, fruits and vegetables as well as low-fat dairy alternatives.
Women are classified as underweight if they have a pre-pregnant BMI of 18.5 or below. Low pre-pregnancy BMI increases the risk of low birth weight infants, but the risk can be balanced by an appropriate gestational weight gain from 12.5 to 18.0 kilograms in total, or about 0.5 kilogram each week in the second and third trimesters.
Underweight women usually have inadequate nutrient stores that are not enough to provide for both herself and the fetus. While exercise and a proper diet are both needed to maintain the recommended weight gain, a balance between the two is very important. As such, underweight mothers should seek individualized advice tailored especially for themselves.
Overweight and Obese Women
Women with a high pre-pregnancy weight are classified as overweight or obese, defined as having a BMI of 25 or above. Women with BMI between 25 and 29.9 are in the overweight category and should gain between 7.0 and 11.5 kilograms in total, corresponding to approximately 0.28 kilogram each week during the second and third trimesters. Whereas women with BMI of 30 or above are in the obese category and should gain only between 5.0 and 9.0 kilograms overall, which equates to roughly 0.2 kilogram per week in the second and third trimesters.
In general, walking is encouraged for mothers classified in this category. Unfortunately, estimated energy requirements for them are not available. As such, they are encouraged to record activity and intake level. This can be done with the help of tools such as My Food Guide Servings Tracker from Health Canada and EATracker that are available online. In extreme cases where the BMI exceeds 35, help from a registered dietitian is recommended.
The following table summarizes the recommended rate of weight gain and total weight gain according to pre-pregnancy BMI for singleton pregnancies. The first column categorizes the type of body weight based on the Body Mass Index. The second column summarizes the total recommended weight gain for each type of body weight, and the third column presents the corresponding weekly weight gain during the period when the fetus undergoes rapid growth (during second and third trimesters). In extreme cases, the amount of total and weekly weight gain can vary by a factor of two depending on a woman's pre-pregnant weight. For example, a woman in the obese category is recommended to gain a total of 5~9 kilograms, whereas an underweight woman needs to gain up to 18 kilograms in weight.
|Pre-pregnancy BMI Category||Recommendated Total Weight Gain||Weekly Weight Gain
(after 12 weeks)
|12.5~18 kg (28~40 lb)||0.5 kg (1.0 lb)|
BMI 18.5~ 24.9
|11.5~16 kg (25~35 lb)||0.4 kg (1.0 lb)|
BMI 25.0~ 29.9
|7.0~ 11.5 kg (15~25 lb)||0.3 kg (0.6 lb)|
BMI > 30
|5.0~9.0 kg (11~20 lb)||0.2 kg (0.5 lb)|
Recommendations for Low and High Birth Weight
In order to have a good estimate of birth weight, ultrasonography or ultrasound during pregnancy and the date of last menstrual period are needed. Measured values from ultrasonography are compared with the growth chart to estimate fetal weight.
Crown rump length can be used as the best ultrasonographic measurement for correct diagnosis of gestational age during the first trimester. This correlation between crown rump length and gestational age would be most effectively shown when no growth defects are observed in first trimester. If growth defects were observed in the first trimester, then the measurement of the date of last menstrual period becomes quite important since the crown heel length has become less of a reliable indicator of gestational age.
After the 20th week of pregnancy, the mother would need to visit the doctor for the measurement of fundal height, which is the length from the top portion of the uterus to the pubic bone. The length measured in centimeters should correspond to the number of weeks that the mother has been pregnant. If the measured number is higher or lower than 2 centimetres, further tests using ultrasound would be needed to check the results. Another way to estimate fetal size is to look at the mother’s weight gain. How much weight the mother gains can be used to indicate fetal size.
Low Birth Weight
There are two ways to determine small for gestational age infants. Many research studies agree that SGA babies are those with birth weight or crown heel length measured at two standard deviations or more below the mean of the infant’s gestational age, based on data consisting of a reference population. Other studies classify SGA babies as those with birth weight values below the 10th percentile of the growth chart for babies of the same gestational age. This indicates that these babies are weighing less than 90% of babies of the same gestational age.
Many factors, including maternal, placental, and fetal factors, contribute to the cause of impaired fetal growth. There are a number of maternal factors, which include age, nutritional status, alcohol abuse, smoking, and medical conditions. Insufficient uteroplacental perfusion is an example of a placental factor. Chromosomal abnormalities and genetic diseases are examples of fetal factors. Identification of the causes of SGA for individual cases aids health professionals in finding ways to handle each unique case. Nutritional counseling, education, and consistent monitoring can be helpful to assist women bearing SGA infants.
Complications for the infant include limitations in body growth since the number and size of cells in tissues is smaller. The infant likely did not receive enough oxygen during pregnancy so the oxygen level is low. It is also more difficult to maintain body temperature since there is less blood flow within the small body.
As such, it is necessary to monitor oxygen level to make sure that it doesn’t go too low. If the baby can’t suck well, then it may be necessary for tube-feed. Since the baby cannot maintain body temperature sufficiently, a temperature-controlled bed would help to keep their bodies from losing heat. There are ways to help prevent SGA babies. Monitoring fetal growth can help identify the problem during pregnancy well before birth. It would be beneficial to seek professional help and counseling.
High Birth Weight
Research show that when birth weights of infants are greater than the 90th percentile of the growth chart for babies of the same gestational age, they are considered large for gestational age or LGA. This indicates that these babies are weighing more than 90% of babies of the same gestational age.
Many factors account for LGA babies, including genetics and excessive nutrient supply. It seems that a common factor for LGA babies is whether or not the mother has diabetes when she is pregnant. An indicator for excessive growth, regardless of gestational age, is the appearance of macrosomia. Many complications are observed for LGA babies and their mothers. A longer delivery time may be expected since it is a difficult birth. The infant would likely suffer hypoglycemia (low glucose level in the blood) after birth. The infant would also have difficulty breathing.
There might be a need for early delivery if the baby gets too big and perhaps Caesarean section would be needed. Since the baby is bigger in size, there’s a higher chance of injury when coming out of the mother’s body. To increase the blood glucose level in blood, a glucose/water solution can be offered to the infant.
There are ways to help prevent LGA babies. It is necessary to monitor fetal growth and perform pregnancy examinations to determine health status and detect any possibility of unrecognized diabetes. For diabetic mothers, careful management of diabetes during pregnancy period would be helpful in terms of lowering some of the risks of LGA.
Points to Consider
The goal of pregnancy is to have a healthy baby. Maintaining healthy and steady weight gain during pregnancy promotes overall health and reduces the incidence of prenatal morbidity and mortality. This, in turn, has a positive effect on the baby’s health.
Since conditions during pregnancy will have long term effects on adult health, “moderation” should be taken into account for both dietary and physical activity recommendations. Most importantly, the total recommended pregnancy weight gain depends on pre-pregnant body weight, and weight issues should be addressed before pregnancy.
Future Direction for Research
It is reasonable to expect higher weight gain for multiple gestations. Recommendations for women carrying twins are given but more research should be done to precisely determine the total weight gain, as these ranges are wide. Also, the ranges for underweight women carrying twins is unknown. There was not enough information to recommend weight gain cutoffs and guidelines for women carrying three or more babies, women of short stature (<157 centimetres), and pregnant teens. Estimated energy requirements (EER) for overweight/obese women are unavailable so more research is needed to evaluate on that.
Practical Advice for Mothers
The following general tips can be helpful to pregnant women. It would be beneficial to maintain adequate physical activity to meet energy needs from the food consumed. Eating a balanced diet would be optimal for healthy pregnancy results. To prevent problems like dehydration and constipation, it is important to drink enough fluids, especially water, to support blood volume increases during pregnancy. It is recommended to accompany regular meals with a daily prenatal vitamin supplement that has sufficient folic acid and iron content.
If the fetus is predicted to have low birth weight, in addition to the general recommendations, it would be ideal to increase caloric intake, which can be done by having extra Food Guide Servings daily. If the fetus is predicted to have high birth weight, smaller and more frequent meals should be consumed to allow better weight management. Moderate sugar intake, such as fruit juices, is also suggested. It is essential to limit food and beverages with high calories and salt content.

Explain how maternal malnutrition during gestation contributes to restricted fetal growth and increased disease susceptibility in adulthood, providing specific examples from the Dutch Famine study to support your argument.

Use information from the provided text to describe the effects of maternal malnutrition on fetal development and adult health outcomes, and include at least two references from the Dutch Famine study in your response.


### ANSWER:
Maternal malnutrition during gestation contributes to restricted fetal growth, which in turn increases disease susceptibility in adulthood. According to the text, maternal under-nutrition during gestation limits intrauterine growth, leading to lower birth weights and increased risks of chronic conditions in adult life, such as cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. The Dutch Famine study serves as an epidemiological study that examines the effects of maternal under-nutrition during different gestational stages. For example, the study found that maternal malnutrition during the early stages of gestation has been identified as one of the most important contributor to coronary heart disease as well as other chronic diseases later in life. Additionally, the study found that restricted fetal growth due to maternal malnutrition is associated with changes in physiological and metabolic processes in the body that increase the risk of adult diseases. Importantly, this mechanism of restricted fetal growth and increased disease susceptibility in adulthood is strongly supported by the mechanism of mechanism of developmental plasticity where the fetus adapts to change the body structure and function in response to available nutrient supply for inhibited fetal development and prepare for harsh conditions of food shortages after birth.","### FEEDBACK:  Your response effectively explains how maternal malnutrition during gestation contributes to restricted fetal growth and increased disease susceptibility in adulthood, providing specific examples from the Dutch Famine study to support your argument.

To improve your response, consider adding a clear and concise thesis statement at the beginning to guide the reader through your argument. For example, 'This essay will discuss how maternal malnutrition during gestation contributes to restricted fetal growth and increased disease susceptibility in adulthood, using the Dutch Famine study as a case study.'
Additionally, consider providing more specific examples from the Dutch Famine study to support your argument. For example, you could discuss the study's findings on the effects of maternal malnutrition during different gestational stages, or the study's results on the relationship between birth weight and adult health outcomes."

The Delicious Origins of 18 Summer Fruit Names
Summertime means vacations, swimming pools, barbecues, and bushels of seasonal fruits. But just as juicy as summer’s many berries, stone fruits, and melons are the far-flung, surprising, and often obscure origins of their names.
When the word first appeared in the 16th century, apricot looked like something only the Big Friendly Giant would eat: abrecock. English borrowed abrecock from the Portuguese or Spanish variant of the Arabic name for the fruit: al-barquq, “the apricot.”
But apricot’s journey goes back farther than that. Arabic adapted al-barquq from the Greek praikokion, which itself took the word from Latin’s praecox. Literally meaning “cooked before,” the ancient Romans thought the praecox was a variety of peach that ripened early. According to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), an earlier Latin name for the fruit was prunum or malum Armeniacum, the “Armenian apple,” from where it was historically cultivated.
French formed the fruit’s name into abricot, which influenced the modern English spelling of apricot. The Latin word apricus, meaning “sunny,” likely influenced the spelling too; the fruit was believed to ripen in such an environment.
Some think the word peach is first attested in the English language all the way back in 1184 as the surname Pecche. This name is more likely from the French for “sin.” Despite fruit having a long religious association with sin, peach probably first appears in 1400, when pechis, and later peche, was used to mean the “peach tree.”
Via French, the English peche was grafted from the Latin persica, short for Persicum malum, or the “Persian apple.”
Peachy was U.S. slang for “great”—and of women, “attractive”—by 1900. This usage probably stems from the fruit’s alluring shape or color, at least in the eyes of some beholders.
A nectarine is a peach that lost its fuzz. Documented in various forms in the early 17th century, the name nectarine derives from a literary adjective, nectarine, “sweet as nectar.” Via Latin, nectar derives from the Greek nektar, the drink of the Olympian gods. Some think nectar is a Greek compound of nek- (“death”) and tar- (“overcoming”), alluding to the drink’s mythical power to bestow immortality. So, you better stock up on nectarines this summer.
A prune is a dried plum, but the word plum might just be dried prune. It’s a very old word in the language, found as plum in Old English. Scholars can trace it back to Middle Dutch and Middle Low German prume as well as the Old High German pfruma.
The ultimate origins of these Germanic plums are disputed. Some think early Germanic speakers borrowed the Latin prunum, a “plum,” possibly of a Near East origin. Prunum also gives English prune.
Whatever their roots, plum and prune originally referred to the same thing: the plum. They diverged in the 1400s, thanks to the phrase dried prunes. They diverged again, thanks to metaphor. Prune became slang for a “disagreeable person,” later an “old person.” Plum, meanwhile, became slang for something “desirable,” hence a plum job. Earlier, plum was a British colloquialism for 100,000 pounds, a nod to sweet sugar plums.
What do cherries and peas have in common? Yes, they’re both small and round, but they are also both mistakes. Middle English mistook cherise, which came from France, as a plural word. It’s not, but speakers made cheri, later cherry, the word’s singular form anyway. English also did this to pea: The original, singular word was pease.
The French cherise replaced the Old English ciris. Unlike peach, cherry does appear in an old surname: Chyrimuth, “cherry mouth.” (Cherries have long been associated with lips.) Both cherise and ciris are ultimately picked from the Latin cerasum, “cherry tree,” and the Greek kerasos before it. Kerasos might refer to a town in an ancient region of the Black Sea area of Turkey called Pontus; Romans believed one of their statesman, Lucullus, brought cherries back from there—but it’s possible that the town itself was named after cherries.
Technically, the strawberry isn’t a berry. So, does the fruit’s straw- actually have anything to do with straw? Etymologists simply don’t know. It’s an unusual word, as the Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology explains: “No corresponding compound is found in other Germanic languages and the reason for the name is uncertain.” Some suggest its ""seeds"" (called achenes, they’re the actual fruit of the strawberry) look like scattered straw, others that its slender stems (“runners”) resemble straw stalks.
Like the strawberry, the raspberry isn’t a true berry in the biological sense of the word. And also like the word strawberry, we don’t know what its rasp- is about.
The word raspberry is found relatively late in English, attested in the early 1600s. An earlier form, raspis-berry, might give clues to its origins. In Middle English, raspise was a sweet, pink wine, possibly from the Anglo-Latin vinum raspeys. But this raspeys remains unexplained. Suggestions include the French rasper, “to scrape,” referring to the fruit’s rough appearance, and an Old Walloon word for “thicket.”
The other sense of raspberry, the noise we make, say, when we blow on someone’s stomach, is short for raspberry tart, rhyming slang for “fart.”
8., 9., 10., 11., 12., AND 13. GOOSEBERRIES, ELDERBERRIES, MULBERRIES, LOGANBERRIES, BOYSENBERRIES, AND BLACKBERRIES
Gooseberries might have nothing to do with geese and elderberries have no relation to older people: If the goose- is to do with the animal, no one has yet found a reason for this to be the case; while the elder- definitely has to do with the elder plant, but the name origin of that is tangled in the etymological bush. Mulberries are actually mulling over morons, well, the Greek moron, its name for the mulberry. This moron also appears in the second element of sycamore.
But other berry-like fruits do have clear origins: loganberries and boysenberries are named for the scientists who developed them. And blackberries? Finally, summer fruit lobs us an easy one: It’s because they are black.
Like blackberry, watermelon is another summer fruit whose name is straightforward, thanks to its light juice. But melon seems anything but a melon: Etymologically, it’s basically “apple pumpkin.”
Passing into English from French and Latin, melon ultimately comes from the Greek melopepon, joining melon (“apple”) and pepon (“gourd”). Pepon is a form of the Greek verb “to cook”; as we saw with apricot, the notion is that melon was cooked, or ripened, by the sun. Pepon is also the source of the first part of pumpkin. The -kin is a diminutive suffix also seen in napkin, which we definitely need when we eat melons.
Due to its sweet, ivory-green juice, this melon is likened to honeydew: a sugary, sticky liquid secreted by insects, often on plants. According to the folk etymology, people once believed this honey-like substance materialized from the air like dew. Honeydew melon is late to the English record; the OED first cites it in 1916.
This melon also owes its origins to the Middle East. Legend says it was brought from Armenia to Cantalupo, a former papal estate outside of Rome where the fruit was grown. Legend has it that wolves once gathered and howled around this area, hence Cantalupo, the “singing wolf,” joining Latin words for “sing” (cantare) and “wolf” (lupus). But while most etymologists agree that it’s probably named after a place called Cantalupo, it’s very possible that the papal connection is a myth. No matter what, the English language didn’t start howling over its orange flesh until the mid 1700s.
17. AND 18. LEMON AND LIME
Finally, these seasonal citrus fruits go well together in poolside drinks, but their names originate in places we don’t always associate with water. They both were squeezed into English from French, then Spanish, then Arabic, and finally from the Persian limun, a collective word for “citrus.” Lemon, appearing around 1400, predates lime in the English record by over 200 years.
A lemon is also a substandard car, usually passed off as in good condition. Describing something “bad” or “flawed” as a lemon dates back to the beginning of the 20th century. This usage might originate in American criminal slang of the early 1900s: The smarter con man could suck the juice out right out of a lemon, a “sucker” or “loser.” More likely, the slang is because the lemon leaves a sour taste—unlike so many of the delicious fruits in this article and their scrumptious etymologies. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Fruitful Explorations: Unraveling Etymological Connections

Choose a summer fruit from the article and research its non-culinary historical references or associations. Create a visually appealing infographic that highlights these connections and explains their significance. Be sure to include the fruit's etymology as the central piece of information and explore at least two additional historical or cultural references related to the fruit. Your infographic should be concise, informative, and creatively designed.


### ANSWER:
I choose the peach as the summer fruit for this assignment. The peach's etymology is rooted in the Latin word 'persica,' meaning 'Persian apple.' One historical reference to peaches is their association with immortality in ancient Chinese culture. In Chinese mythology, peaches were a symbol of eternal life and were often depicted in art as a fruit that granted longevity. Another cultural reference is the peach's connection to the color pink in Western societies. In the 17th century, the term 'peachy' emerged as a slang term for something that was excellent or of high quality, and later, in the 20th century, the term 'peach' was used to describe something or someone that was visually appealing, particularly in reference to skin tone.","### FEEDBACK:  Great start on exploring the peach's etymology and historical references. To further enhance your infographic, consider adding a visual representation of the peach's Latin origin and its connection to the Chinese mythology of immortality. Additionally, you could include a section on the cultural significance of the peach in Western societies, such as its association with the color pink and its use as a slang term for something excellent or visually appealing.

To address the first error, you could include a diagram or illustration that shows the peach's etymological roots in Latin and its connection to the Chinese mythology of immortality. This would help to visually represent the peach's complex history and cultural significance.
To address the second error, you could include a section on the cultural significance of the peach in Western societies, such as its association with the color pink and its use as a slang term for something excellent or visually appealing. This would help to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the peach's cultural significance and its impact on Western societies."

Margarine: A Closer Look
Margarine has its origins in France. In 1866 the French Government launched a competition that called for research into the development of a reasonably priced nutritive fat to be used as an alternative to butter.
In 1869, a French chemist named Hippolyte Mège-Mouriés discovered the recipe for margarine using a mixture of beef tallow and skim milk. He won the competition prize and was granted a patent for his invention in France and England.
In 1871, Mr. Mège-Mouriés sold his knowledge to the Dutch firm Jurgens, a company which eventually became the giant food corporation known as Unilever. Unilever was created in 1930 by the merger of British soapmaker Lever Brothers and Dutch producer Margarine Uni. The merger was logical for both companies, as palm oil was a major raw material for both products and could be imported more efficiently in larger quantities.
The first margarine factory was built in Germany in 1872 and the first US factory was built between 1874 – 1876.
At first, the margarine was made from beef tallow and milk. But the price of tallow created a need for a cheaper fat source.
In the 1890s, the meat packing monopoly controlled the price of lard and tallow needed to make candles and soap. Candle maker William Proctor and his brother-in-law, soap-maker James Gamble, combined their companies and took steps to gain control of the cottonseed oil business from farm to factory, with the aim of forcing tallow, (and the meat packers) out of the candle and soap business.
By 1905, the two men owned several cottonseed mills in Mississippi. In 1909, P&G acquired the patent for the science of hydrogenation from Joseph Crossfield and Sons, a British company. By forcing the addition of hydrogen atoms to the fatty acid chain, this revolutionary industrial process transformed liquid cottonseed oil into a solid that resembled lard. This hydrogenation process was incorporated into the making of oil based spreads.
Eventually, soybean oil became the main ingredient. By the mid 1930s, margarine was made with hydrogenated soybean oil, along with some added vitamin A and D. Consumption increased during the Depression years, and further increased significantly during World War II as butter was reserved for the soldiers fighting in Europe.
The Nasty Process of Making Margarine
Today, the production of margarine is a unappetizing process which uses several toxic chemicals. Here’s an overview of the steps involved:
- Vegetable oil is made from oil seeds such as soybeans, corn, cottonseed or canola. The seeds are cleaned and crushed and the oil is extracted by applying high temperatures and pressure.
- Since heat and light accelerate the rate of the reaction between polyunsaturated oils and oxygen, this extraction process causes the oils to become rancid, producing unpleasant and noxious odors and flavors.
- Any oil left in the seed pulp is removed with noxious solvents such as hexane, an known neurotoxin.
- The crude oil is then degummed with acid to remove other impurities, and a caustic soda is added to remove the degumming acids.
- The resulting gray and smelly oil is bleached with Fuller’s earth (the same ingredient used in cat litter) and then filtered.
- The rancid smells are removed through a high temperature steam cleaning deodorization process. This destroys any remaining nutrients and antioxidants.
- The refined oil is mixed with a nickel catalyst and subjected to hydrogen gas in a high pressure, high temperature reactor. The high temperature and pressure in the presence of the nickel catalyst forces hydrogen atoms into the oil molecules, creating a partially solid, saturated product. This process is called hydrogenation. It is at this point that dangerous trans fats are created. Basically, the artificially created saturated fat molecules make their double bonds in the wrong places. These molecular misfits have been linked to inflammation, blood platelet stickiness, insulin resistance and other health problems.
- The resulting gray, smelly grease is filtered to remove the leftover toxic nickel and other suspended materials.
- The grease is then mixed with soap-like emulsifiers, then steam cleaned to remove the obnoxious odors.
- The mixture is then bleached to remove the gray color, and artificial flavors, synthetic vitamins and natural colors (synthetic coloring is dangerous!) are added to improve the appearance and taste.
- The mixture is now extruded into plastic tubs for sale.
- Finally, clever advertising and marketing campaigns are implemented to promote the final product as a health food to the unsuspecting public, usually with the full endorsement of many scientists, doctors, nutritionists and health authorities.
As you can see from the process above, oil based spreads are NOT health foods, and should be avoided. Instead, choose real, clean butter, preferably in raw or cultured form. In the butter vs margarine
debate, butter is the clear winner.

Create a critical evaluation of the hydrogenation process used in the production of margarine, considering both its technical and health implications.

Explain the chemical reactions involved in the hydrogenation process and its effects on the molecular structure of vegetable oils.
Discuss the potential health risks associated with the consumption of hydrogenated oils, including the creation of trans fats and their impact on human health.
Consider alternative methods for producing solid vegetable oils, such as enzymatic inter-esterification or blending with natural saturated fats, and evaluate their advantages and limitations.


### ANSWER:
The hydrogenation process in margarine production involves the reaction of vegetable oils with hydrogen gas in the presence of a nickel catalyst, resulting in the formation of trans fatty acids. This process has significant implications for both the technical and health aspects of the final product, including the potential health risks associated with trans fat consumption. Alternative methods, such as enzymatic inter-esterification or blending with natural saturated fats, offer potential advantages but also have limitations. Overall, a balanced evaluation of the hydrogenation process is crucial for understanding its impact on the production of margarine and its effects on human health.","### FEEDBACK:  The evaluation provides a good overview of the hydrogenation process and its implications, but could be strengthened by a more detailed explanation of the chemical reactions involved and a more critical analysis of the health risks associated with trans fat consumption.

To improve the evaluation, consider providing a more detailed explanation of the chemical reactions involved in the hydrogenation process, including the specific molecular structures involved and the effects of the nickel catalyst on the reaction.
Additionally, consider providing a more critical analysis of the health risks associated with trans fat consumption, including a discussion of the potential mechanisms by which trans fats contribute to health problems and a consideration of the limitations of current research in this area."
"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
Questions like these teach us an important lesson: Images never speak the truth in and of themselves. Rather, the ensuing debates centred around the provenance of the evidence, the credibility of the source and, of course, the (hidden?) motives behind the editorial decisions.
While the examples above are well-known, the everyday production and consumption of programmes, articles, music and images pose related questions all the time.
Drawing the line between fact, opinion, entertainment and advertising is a difficult job, both for media users and providers. The skill used to do so is often referred to as media literacy: 'the ability to access, understand and create communications in a variety of contexts'.
To illustrate why media literacy is never trivial, research suggests that the traditional journalistic trope of value; balanced reporting, may in fact be the very cause of bias.
A scientific study found that ""denial discourse"" around climate change was granted far more media attention than merited in the scientific discourse, thereby delaying action for reasons of ""uncertainty"".
In the face of 'information overload', there is a threat that people will choose to either switch off completely or only trust a very limited number of media sources. In turn, this has an impact on people's ability to participate fully in a democratic and plural society.
The phenomenon is known as strategic ignorance. A survey by Gallup found, for example, that 41% of Americans, predominantly among those aged 30 and older, believe that the seriousness of global warming is exaggerated in the news; a record-high since surveys began in 1997.
As we get information thrown at us and use a variety of media platforms to stay up-to-date, media literacy skills are absolutely fundamental to citizenship in modern society. This is about more than browsing the news; those in the know may enjoy more empowered lives, as they comfortably navigate the wealth of options on offer. From social networking, to getting directions, to understanding food labelling, to getting the best insurance deal, being media literate is as much about finding a 'voice' as it is about being a critical recipient.
Indeed, as defined by Prof Sonia Livingstone, Head of the Media Department at the LSE, ""the promise of media literacy, surely, is that it can form part of a strategy to reposition the media user - from passive to active, from recipient to participant, from consumer to citizen.""
A working group of media professionals under the Media CSR Forum found that there are three components to media literacy:
Being able to access the media. Barriers to this could be technology or affordability related.
Being able to understand and critically evaluate media. For example, the stages and filters information goes through to become content.
Being able to create/interact with media.
While access is becoming less of an issue, critically evaluating and creating media content remain high on the list of concerns. And since media literacy is not a fixed curriculum, they are bound to stay there as long as new formats and conventions continue to emerge.
But how to enhance media literacy? Digital Britain, the Government's blueprint for a prosperous digital future, noted that ""no single organisation in isolation can effectively promote media literacy and there are many organisations that have a key role to play in the promotion of media literacy – amongst both adults and children."" Undoubtedly, there is a lot to do, both on the 'supply' and the 'demand' side of media content.
Today, the UK Media CSR Forum, a sector-collaboration between 20 of the biggest UK and European media companies, including the Guardian and Observer, is launching a joint website, signposting a range of innovative schemes to tackle media literacy. Examples include:
Learnnewsdesk.co.uk. The Guardian's own online news portal where the content is specifically directed at 9-14 year olds and aligned with the school curriculum.
Power to All People. Virgin Media's partnership with Digital Unite to provide greater access to the internet for the elderly among disadvantaged communities.
Young Journalist. Sky's competition to encourage young people between the ages of 14-19 years old to report on local, national or international news stories that matter to them.
With media literacy now gaining prominence outside the academic circuit, the industry reckons that a central resource for anyone with an interest in media literacy is long overdue.
In addition to the case study section, the website also boasts the opportunity to create and share wacky headlines with friends or colleagues. Although light-hearted, it is nevertheless a useful way of demonstrating that nothing should ever be accepted at face value.
The website can be reached through howmediaismade.com or elviswalks.com. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

In the second paragraph, define media literacy and its three components, discussing the importance of promoting these skills in both adults and children. Limit your response to 200-250 words.


### ANSWER:
The text suggests that yes, researchers have proven that citizens who actively analyse the media are better equipped to participate in democratic societies. A study on 'denial discourse' around climate change provides a good example of this. It found that when media reporting is biased, it can delay action by creating 'uncertainty'. Therefore, it is essential for citizens to critically evaluate information and avoid misinformation that can hinder their participation in democratic and plural societies. By doing so, they will be empowered to make informed decisions and engage in discussions about global issues such as climate change. By enhancing citizens' media analysis skills, they can mitigate the impact of biased reporting and develop the critical thinking necessary to participate in a democratic society. Media literacy is the skill needed to access, understand, and create communications in a variety of contexts.

- ""Arriving at the prison now.""
Prisons were installations primarily used for incarcerating individuals.
Types of prisons
Different prisons used various methods to contain individuals, either through locking them in a physical cage, or with the use of simple force field barriers or containment fields, such as those used by the Geonosians. Some containment devices, such as Force cages, could also be modified to project electrical currents through the captured individuals as a form of torture.
The Rakata were known to utilize an incarceration method called the mind prison, where the prisoner's mind would be stripped from his or her body and be locked away within the prison, presumably forever. According to one prisoner, the only means of escape was by transferring the imprisoned mind into the body of another who had inadvertently become trapped, although this required the consent of both involved.
Entire planets were occasionally used as prisons. Planets such as Mytus VII, also known as Stars' End, was known as one of the most dreaded prison planets in the galaxy. Despayre was another prison planet used by the Galactic Empire, but was destroyed by the Death Star's superlaser as part of a test of its firepower.
Also the Jedi Order kept a secret prison to hold dangerous sometimes Force-sensitive beings.
Belsavis was one of the oldest prisons in existence, a super-prison constructed by the Infinite Empire. It contained extremely ferocious prisoners, and was adapted for use by the Galactic Republic during the Great Galactic War. Unfortunately for the Republic, in the early years of the Cold War, the Sith Empire's Imperial Intelligence discovered its location and sent agents into the prison to liberate important Imperial prisoners, causing the planet to become a battleground.
Desolation Alley was a notable prison on Oovo IV, which held a number of prisoners such as Meeko Ghintee and Bendix Fust. It was also used for podracing, which was virtually the only form of entertainment available to the prisoners. Jango Fett and Zam Wesell both attempted to recover Fust from the heavily guarded prison. It was during this successful escape attempt that Jango Fett procured the Firespray-class patrol ship that he later named the Slave I, after the loss of his original ship in the skirmish.
Possibly the most notable, however, is the prison camp on Kessel which was home to the galaxy's largest spice mining operation. Under Imperial rule, slave labor was extensively used in the mines. Kessel would hold many Rebels prisoners of war during the Galactic Civil War such as Wedge Antilles, who would be rescued by Rogue Squadron. The crime lord Tyber Zann was also incarcerated at Kessel for stealing a Sith holocron from the Empire and the Hutt Cartel. He would later escape thanks to Urai Fen creating a prison riot diversion.

Analyze the Various Prison Types in the Star Wars Universe

Compare and choose one of the following prisons: Rakatan Mind prison, a Jedi secret prison, a whole planet used as a prison like M'Bardi, or Kessel prison. Consider the impact of technological advancements, galactic politics, and societal influences on the development and use of your chosen prison type. Discuss how these factors have shaped the specifics of its structure, the treatment of its prisoners, and the role it plays within the larger Star Wars universe.


### ANSWER:
The Kessel prison is the most notable example of how technological advancements, galactic politics, and societal influences have shaped the development and use of a prison in the Star Wars Universe.","### FEEDBACK:  
The Kessel prison is a prime example of how technological advancements, galactic politics, and societal influences have shaped the development and use of a prison in the Star Wars Universe. The prison's use of slave labor, extensive mining operations, and harsh conditions demonstrate the impact of technological advancements on the treatment of prisoners. The fact that the prison was used by the Empire to house Rebel prisoners of war, such as Wedge Antilles, highlights the role of galactic politics in shaping the prison's purpose and population. Furthermore, the prison's connection to the spice mining industry and the crime lord Tyber Zann's escape attempt illustrate the societal influences that have shaped the prison's structure and operations.

The answer could be strengthened by providing more specific examples of how technological advancements, galactic politics, and societal influences have shaped the Kessel prison. For instance, the answer could discuss how the Empire's use of slave labor and the prison's connection to the spice mining industry reflect the societal influences at play.
The answer could benefit from a clearer structure and organization. Consider breaking the answer into clear paragraphs or sections to improve its readability and clarity."

Refugee Nutrition Information System
Every year, thousands of individuals are displaced from their homes and homelands because of wars, political conflicts, and natural disasters. The Refugee Nutrition Information System (RNIS) was established in 1993 to collect data and report on the nutrition, health, and survival status of the most nutritionally vulnerable people in the world, including refugees, internally displaced populations, and those who are forced to migrate.
These girls are among more than four million Palestinian refugees in Gaza Strip and the West Bank. A recent report from the Refugee Nutrition Information System found Palestinian refugees to be satisfactorily coping with the nutritional impacts of the latest Intifada.
These refugees were displaced by years of warfare in their own countries. In the 1980s they came to Sudan from Ethiopia and Chad, only to find a famine awaiting them.
The RNIS publication, Report on the Nutrition Situation of Refugees and Displaced Populations, is published every three months, with interim updates as needed. The United Nations (UN) Administration Committee on Coordination Sub Committee on Nutrition (ACC/SCN) compiles this report. Information is obtained from a variety of UN agencies and nongovernmental organizations.
The report focuses primarily on sub-Saharan Africa, with some information provided on Asia. The report gives an estimate of the total number of refugees and displaced persons, and of the returning population, broken down by risk category. Refugees and displaced populations are classified by country of origin and country of asylum. The report also shows trends over time in total numbers and risk categories.
The report is organized by ""situation,"" a category that crosses national boundaries, and it includes a section that highlights the most pressing humanitarian needs. Recommendations are made by agencies or individuals directly involved in assessments or humanitarian response. Nutritional surveys are used to assess populations that are in a critical situation. Populations at high risk are identified either on the basis of indicators that are approaching crisis levels or through subjective information collected when security and logistical issues prevent rigorous data collection.

EPFL and Technion researchers have figured out the “champion” nanostructures able to produce hydrogen in the most environmentally friendly and cheap manner, by simply using daylight.
In the quest for the production of renewable and clean energy, photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) constitute a sort of a Holy Grail. PECs are devices able of splitting water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen in a single operation, thanks to solar radiation. “As a matter of fact, we’ve already discovered this precious chalice, says Michael Grätzel, Director of the Laboratory of Photonics and Interfaces (LPI) at EPFL and inventor of dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells. Today we have just reached an important milestone on the path that will lead us forward to profitable industrial applications.”
This week, Nature Materials is indeed publishing a groundbreaking article on the subject. EPFL researchers, working with Avner Rotschild from Technion (Israel), have managed to accurately characterize the iron oxide nanostructures to be used in order to produce hydrogen at the lowest possible cost. “The whole point of our approach is to use an exceptionally abundant, stable and cheap material: rust,” adds Scott C. Warren, first author of the article.
At the end of last year, Kevin Sivula, one of the collaborators at the LPI laboratory, presented a prototype electrode based on the same principle. Its efficiency was such that gas bubbles emerged as soon as it was under a light stimulus. Without a doubt, the potential of such cheap electrodes was demonstrated, even if there was still room for improvement.
By using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques, researchers were able to precisely characterize the movement of the electrons through the cauliflower-looking nanostructures forming the iron oxide particles, laid on electrodes during the manufacturing process. “These measures have helped us understand the reason why we get performance differences depending on the electrodes manufacturing process”, says Grätzel.

Using the information about the EPFL and Technion research on photoelectrochemical cells (PECs), think creatively about the potential impact of this technology on your daily life. 

Describe one way you think PECs could be used in your home or community to produce clean energy.
Explain how the use of iron oxide (rust) as a material in PECs could affect the cost of this technology.


### ANSWER:
1. PECs could be used in my home to create a self-sustaining backyard pond that produces oxygen and hydrogen from sunlight, providing a constant source of clean energy while also creating a thriving ecosystem. 2. The use of iron oxide as a material in PECs could significantly reduce the production cost, making this technology more acessable, and positioning this tech better than the current market standards. ","### FEEDBACK:  
Your ideas about using PECs in a backyard pond and reducing production costs are creative and thought-provoking. However, there are a couple of areas that need more attention.

To strengthen your first point, consider providing more details about how the PECs would be integrated into the pond's ecosystem. For example, you could explain how the oxygen produced would support aquatic life, or how the hydrogen could be used to power a small generator for the home.
Regarding your second point, it's essential to acknowledge the potential environmental implications of using iron oxide in PECs. You could discuss how the use of rust might affect the device's durability, or how it could impact the overall efficiency of the technology."

Oracle With Clause :
In my previous article i have given the different SQL tutorials with real life examples.In this article i will give you the Oracle With Clause information with its examples. You might have seen that so many reporting tool queries starts with Oracle With Clause.The With Clause is mainly used to improve the performance of the specific query.The Oracle 9i provides the new functionality of With Clause.The with clause is just like temporary tables in oracle.Mainly the with clause is used to execute subqueries in fast way.It is called as sub-query factoring.
Oracle With Clause Syntax and Examples :
In this section i would like to explain the syntax as well as examples of With clause in oracle.Before checking the syntax and examples of With clause in oracle let us first check some important bullet points of With Clause :
- With Clause in Oracle is released in Oracle 9i release 2 to improve the performance of complex sql queries.
- The clause works like a global temporary tables of oracle which is used to improve the query speed of complex sql queries.
- This technique is also called as sub-query factoring as it is used to De-factor the subqueries.
- With clause in oracle is not supported by all oracle versions ,the oracle version 9i and beyond versions.
- When sub-query needs to be executed multiple times at that time With clause is used.
- The name which is assigned to the sub-query is treated as though it was an inline view or table.
- The With Clause is useful in Recursive queries as well.
These are some important points of With Clause in oracle. In following section i would like to explain about the syntax as well as multiple examples of with clause.
With SQL_Query_Name As
Select * from New_SQL_Query_name;
Execution of With Clause :
In this section i would like to explain about the step by step execution of With clause.
Step 1 : The SQL Query within the with clause is executed at first step.
Step 2 : The output of the SQL query is stored in to temporary relation of with clause.
Step 3 : The Main query is executed with temporary relation produced at last stage.
With Clause with Aggregation :
In this section i would like to give you example with its syntax for With clause with aggregation.There are so many times the With clause is used in oracle .
(The aggregation SQL statement)
(query name sub-query_name);
Real life example 1 :
Let us take the example of Student table.If user wants to find out the Students from Student table whose marks is more than Average of all marks.
(Select Avg(Marks) From Student),
Select Roll_No,Name,Marks From Student , Student_Temp
Where Student.Marks > Student_Temp.Average_Marks);
The above example will give you the Students whose marks are greater than average marks with using With Clause with Aggregation.
Real Life Example 2 :
There are some situations where user needs to calculate Salary of the Employee with Total number of the Employees and user needs to show it department-wise then following query is useful.
With Department_Count As
Select Dept_No,Count(Emp_No) As ‘No_Of_Employees’
Group by Dept_No
From Employee E,
Where E.Dept_no = C.Dept_No;
Points to Remember :
In this section, I would like to give some important points to remember while using With Clause in Oracle.
Point 1 :
The With clause in Oracle can be beneficial for complex SQL queries. For Simple SQL queries dont use with clause to make it complicated.
Point 2 :
The with clause fragments the complex subqueries in to queries.It is used for simple debugging of the query.
Point 3 :
The With clause in oracle is nothing but the drop -in replacement for normal subqueries.
Point 4 :
When User find the sub-query and needs to improve the performance ; Try to use With clause and convert that sub-query in to With clause query to improve the performance.
These are above some most important points to remember while using With clause in Oracle. I hope this article will be useful for users. If you like this article or if you have any concerns with the same kindly comment in to comments section. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
SQL Query Optimization Using Oracle With Clause

Create a real-life SQL query scenario where using an Oracle With Clause can significantly improve query performance, and include an explanation of the benefits of using the With Clause in this specific scenario.


### ANSWER:
Consider a real-life scenario where we have a large table called ‘Orders’ with millions of rows, and we need to calculate the total value of orders for each customer, as well as the percentage of the total value contributed by each customer. Without using the With Clause, the query would look like this: SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_value) as total_value,  (SUM(order_value) / (SELECT SUM(order_value) FROM Orders)) * 100 as percentage FROM Orders GROUP BY customer_id; However, this query is inefficient because it needs to calculate the total sum of order values for each row. By using the With Clause, we can precalculate the total sum and improve performance: WITH total_orders AS ( SELECT SUM(order_value) as total FROM Orders ) SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_value) as total_value,  (SUM(order_value) / (SELECT total FROM total_orders)) * 100 as percentage FROM Orders GROUP BY customer_id; The benefits of using the With Clause here are that it avoids the correlated subquery and calculates the total sum only once, reducing the computational overhead and improving query performance.","### FEEDBACK:  Your explanation of the benefits of using the With Clause in the scenario is clear and concise. However, there are a couple of areas for improvement.

You mentioned that the With Clause avoids the correlated subquery, but it's more accurate to say that it avoids the correlated subquery in the original query. The With Clause itself does not contain a correlated subquery.
You correctly identified the benefits of using the With Clause, but you could have also mentioned that the With Clause allows for easier maintenance and modification of the query, as the precalculated total sum is defined in a separate section."

The series of posts on the National Debt keeps growing. I spent months researching the topic in an attempt to understand its history and evolution.
My first draft of this series of seven posts was at least three-times longer than the final copy. It is confusing enough, so I cut.
However, this morning I awoke wanting to know how much of the national debt each president and his congress was responsible for.
The reason I do not blame just the presidents is because each president submits the annual budget to Congress and Congress may add to or subtract from what the president requests. Then Congress must vote to enact the budget and the president signs it into law. Then there is the mandatory part of the budget and the discretionary portion. The president and Congress, without cooperation, cannot do much about the mandatory section of the budget such as Social Security.
For the sake of simplicity, I did not attempt to do the math to discover the exact amount each president (except G.W. Bush and Obama) is responsible for beyond his term in office, because if President Truman is responsible for $8.6 Billion of today’s $16.3509 Trillion national debt, then he is also responsible for the annual interest on that $8.6 Billion and the interest compounded annually on that interest for sixty years. If someone wants to figure that out, be my guest. But first, you would have to know what the interest rate was for each year of those sixty years after Truman left office and the interest seems to change every three months.
For example, I found a post at Intellectual Take Out.org on the interest rates of the national debt starting in 1970 (you may notice that the interest rate has been as high as 14% and as low as 0.1%. At the end of 2010, the interest was 1.7%).
Each President’s (and his Congress) share of the National Debt
- Truman’s share of the National Debt was $8.6 Billion.
- Eisenhower’s share was $5.6 Billion.
- Kennedys share was $3.3 Billion.
- LBJ’s share was $9.3 Billion.
- Nixon’s share was $54.6 Billion.
- Ford’s share was $48.4 Billion.
- Carter’s share was $168.8 Billion.
- Reagan’s share was $2.2376 Trillion.
- G. H. W. Bush’s share was $1.143 Trillion.
- Clinton’s share was $74 Billion.
- G. W. Bush’s share was $6.3002 Trillion.
- Obama’s share is currently about $2 Trillion.
THE DETAILS OF THE RESEARCH:
When Harry Truman became president (1945 – 1952), the National Debt from World War II was $260.1 Billion. The Interest on the debt during Truman’s term as president was $32.6 Billion. Truman was responsible for about $8.6 Billion of that interest.
The National debt Eisenhower (1953 – 1960) inherited from President Truman in 1953 was $266 Billion—an increase of $5.9 Billion. During Eisenhower’s term as president the interest on the debt was $44.8 Billion. Eisenhower was responsible for about $5.6 Billion.
The debt Kennedy (1961 – 1963) inherited from Eisenhower in 1961 was $292.6 Billion—an increase of $26.6 Billion. The interest on the debt during Kennedy’s years as president was $14.4 Billion.
The debt LBJ (1963 – 1968) inherited from Kennedy after his assassination in 1963 was $310.3 Billion—an increase of $17.7 Billion. The interest on the debt during LBJ’s years as president was $55.3 Billion. LBJ was responsible for about $9.1 Billion.
The debt Nixon (1969 – 1973) inherited from LBJ in 1969 was $365.8 Billion—an increase of $55.5 Billion. The interest during his term was $74.7 Billion. Nixon is responsible for about $11.2 Billion.
The debt Ford (1974 – 1976) inherited from Nixon in 1971 was $483.9 Billion—an increase of $118.1 Billion. The interest during his term was $70.9 Billion. Ford is responsible for $6.7 Billion.
The debt Carter (1977 – 1980) inherited from Ford in 1977 was $706.4 Billion—an increase of $222.5 Billion. The interest during his term was $160.5 Billion. Carter is responsible for about $40.9 Billion.
The debt Reagan (1981 – 1988) inherited from Carter in 1981 was $994.8 Billion—an increase of $188.4 Billion. The interest during his term was $910.6 Billion, and Reagan was responsible for about $360.2 Billion.
The debt G. H. W. Bush (1989 – 1992) inherited from Reagan in 1989 was $2.878 Trillion—an increase of $1.8832 Trillion. The interest during his term was $747 Billion, and he was responsible for about $71 Billion.
The debt Clinton (1993 – 2000) inherited from G. H. W. Bush in 1993 was $4.351 Trillion—an increase of $1.474 Trillion. The interest during his four year term was $1.6097 Trillion, and he was responsible for about $201 Billion.
The debt G. W. Bush (2001- 2008) inherited from Clinton in 2001 was $5.7699 Billion—an increase of $1.419 Trillion. The interest during his term was $1.291 Trillion, and he was responsible for about $234 Billion.
The debt Obama (2009 – ) inherited from G. W. Bush in 2009 was $11.8759 Billion—an increase of $6.106 Trillion. The interest during Obama’s first term in office was $833.0 Billion, and he is responsible for about $86.3 Billion.
In December 2012, at the end of President Obama’s first term, the National Debt had increased to $16.3509 Trillion—an increase of $4.475 Trillion.
However, President Obama inherited two wars. To be fair, the cost of those wars since he has been in office was subtracted from the total that he contributed to the national debt along with the interest that goes with the cost of the wars. Obama also inherited the 2007-08 global financial crises, and TARP funds were approved during G. W. Bush’s presidency so that amount was also added to Bush.
- In 2009, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan cost $155.1 Billion.
- In 2010, the cost was $171.0 Billion.
- In 2011, the cost was $170.7 Billion.
G. W. Bush’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) of October 2008 started out at $700 Billion but was reduced to $475 Billion by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Act in July 2010, and President Obama signed it into federal law.
In addition, Fact Check.org says, “The truth is that the nearly 18 percent spike in spending in fiscal 2009 — for which the president is sometimes blamed entirely — was mostly due to appropriations and policies that were already in place when Obama took office.
“That includes spending for the bank-bailout legislation approved by President Bush. Annual increases in amounts actually spent since fiscal 2009 have been relatively modest. In fact, spending for the first seven months of the current fiscal year is running slightly below the same period last year, and below projections.
“Obama can be fairly assigned responsibility for a maximum of $203 billion in additional spending for that year. (2009).
“It can be argued that the total should be lower. Economist Daniel J. Mitchell of the libertarian CATO Institute — who once served on the Republican staff of the Senate Finance Committee — has put the figure at $140 billion.
Total spending for G. W. Bush’s last two budget years was $2.9825 Trillion for 2008 and $3.5177 Trillion for 2009 (President Bush requested $2.7 Trillion, but Congress enacted $3.518 Trillion).
For 2010, President Obama requested $3.552 Trillion, and Congress enacted $3.721 Trillion. For Revenue, Obama requested $2.381 Trillion, and Congress enacted $2.165 Trillion,
In 2011, Obama requested $3.834 Trillion, and Congress enacted $3.630 Trillion. For Revenue, Obama requested $2.567 Trillion, and Congress enacted $2.314 Trillion.
In 2012, Obama requested $3.729 Trillion, and Congress enacted $3.796 Trillion. For Revenue, Obama requested $2.627 Trillion, and Congress enacted $2.469 Trillion.
In conclusion, President Obama requested $667 Billion in revenues that Congress did not enact and Congress spent $32 billion more than Obama requested for 2010 – 2012. One could argue that Congress was responsible for $699 Billion in spending for those years—not President Obama.

National Debt Analysis

Calculate and compare the total contributions to the national debt by each president from Truman to Obama, excluding the mandatory portion of the budget, wars (for Obama), and interest rates.


### ANSWER:
According to the text, the total contributions to the national debt by each president are: Truman ($8.6 Billion), Eisenhower ($5.6 Billion), Kennedy ($3.3 Billion), LBJ ($9.3 Billion), Nixon ($54.6 Billion), Ford ($48.4 Billion), Carter ($168.8 Billion), Reagan ($2.2376 Trillion), G. H. W. Bush ($1.143 Trillion), Clinton ($74 Billion), G. W. Bush ($6.3002 Trillion), Obama ($2 Trillion). Obama's contribution excludes the cost of wars since he took office. To compare, we can calculate the total percentage of the national debt contributed by each president: Truman (0.05%), Eisenhower (0.03%), Kennedy (0.02%), LBJ (0.06%), Nixon (0.33%), Ford (0.3%), Carter (1%), Reagan (13.7%), G. H. W. Bush (7%), Clinton (0.45%), G. W. Bush (38.7%), Obama (12.3%).","### FEEDBACK:  National Debt Analysis

The calculation of total contributions to the national debt by each president is mostly correct, but there are a couple of errors.

Banquo Timeline and Summary
- 1.3: Banquo is the first to notice the three weird sisters on the ride back from battle with Macbeth. He wonders at their natures, sensing something is foul by the fact that they seem to inhabit the earth, yet they don't look as things of the earth. When the witches hail Macbeth with his accursed good news, Banquo comments what they say seems nice, and he wonders why Macbeth looks so afraid.
- Rather than be afraid himself, he asks the women to look into his future, to say whether it is good or bad. They tell him that he'll bear a line of kings, though he won't be one, and he will at once be greater and lesser than Macbeth, and happier and less happy than Macbeth.
- The witches disappear, and Banquo wonders whether he and Macbeth have eaten ""the insane root"" since they have seen such fantastical things as these women.
- When Ross enters announcing that Macbeth is now Thane of Cawdor (just as the witches prophesied), Banquo asks if the Devil can speak true.
- While Macbeth is already hatching his nasty plan, Banquo is cautious. He notes that the deepest consequences can come from trifling with evil, which would tell you nice things in order to bring you over to the dark side. Banquo notices Macbeth is distracted, and agrees to speak with him on it later.
- 1.4: Banquo is greeted by Duncan as Macbeth is, and though he is given no specific honor, he is told that he is close to the King's own heart. Banquo humbly insists that any seed of greatness that the King plants in Banquo is the King's to reap.
- 1.6: Banquo goes to Inverness (Macbeth's home) with the King and company. Here, he gives a pretty speech about the home of the martin, judging that if that wonderful bird should make its cradle there, the air must be soft and good. (Banquo, it might be said, is not so astute about how to protect one's family and one's self.)
- 2.1: Banquo and his son Fleance are up late at Macbeth's house. Banquo can't sleep because he is plagued by ""cursed thoughts"" that he says nature brings to him in sleep. He meets Macbeth walking in the hall, and tells him he dreamt of the weird sisters, which Macbeth brushes off. Cryptically, Macbeth tells Banquo if he will support his cause, it would be an honor to Banquo. Banquo replies that his allegiance is clear (implicitly an allegiance to good and to Duncan) and the two again agree to talk more later.
- 2.3: Banquo wakes with all the others upon hearing of the King's murder, and is horrified. While Macbeth is busy making long talk, it is Macduff and Banquo who attend to his wife, who has grown faint on hearing about Macbeth's murder of the guards.
- 3.1: Banquo already suspects Macbeth of some wrongdoing, as the prophecy has come true but in a most awful way. Instead of ruminating on this, Banquo asks whether his part of the prophecy, that he would sire kings, might come true, too. There is no moral tongue wagging here, as Banquo is interrupted by Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, who invite him to dinner after inquiring where he will be at a certain hour of the day. He, innocent of any bad intentions on their part, tells them he will be on a horseback ride with his son Fleance, but will be glad to attend dinner with them later.
- 3.3: Banquo returns to Forres and is about to attend the big dinner when he is accosted by the murderers Macbeth sent. He says it looks like rain, and the murderers have at him. At his dying breath, he denounces what he knows to be Macbeth's treachery, and bids his fleeing son to avenge his honor.
- Note: Banquo's ghost is written into the following banquet scene, and is shown in some productions, while others keep it in the mind's eye of a guilty Macbeth. The ghost does not speak, but gets his haunting on quite effectively anyway.

Analyze the dynamic between Banquo's cautious nature and Macbeth's growing ambition. How does Banquo's awareness of the potential consequences of evil influence his interactions with Macbeth, and what does this reveal about his character?

Cite specific instances from the text where Banquo's caution is evident, and explain how these moments contrast with Macbeth's actions.
Discuss how Banquo's interactions with Macbeth in Act 2, Scene 1, particularly his response to Macbeth's cryptic remarks, demonstrate his character's resistance to evil.
Consider how Banquo's eventual demise serves as a consequence of his underestimation of Macbeth's malevolence, and analyze the significance of his final words.


### ANSWER:
In the dynamic between Banquo's cautious nature and Macbeth's growing ambition, Banquo's awareness of the potential consequences of evil significantly influences his interactions with Macbeth, revealing a character who is astute, morally grounded, and ultimately tragic.","### FEEDBACK:  The analysis provides a good starting point, but it can be strengthened by incorporating more textual evidence and exploring the nuances of Banquo's character.

To improve, consider adding more specific quotes and scenes from the text to support the analysis, such as Banquo's initial reaction to the witches' prophecies or his conversation with Macbeth in Act 2, Scene 1.
Additionally, delve deeper into Banquo's character by examining his motivations, values, and relationships with other characters, such as Macduff or Lady Macbeth. This will provide a richer understanding of his role in the play and the tragic events that unfold."

Basics of Cams
Cams are meant to protect small to large cracks. Cams provide (to a limited extent) multi-directional protection.
Cams work by contracting two set of lobes then placing the cams into a crack smaller than the expanded lobes. By releasing the trigger, the springs push the cam lobes against the sides of a crack. Cams allow you to make placements in parallel cracks (parallel cracks are difficult to protect with passive protection). The force of the lobes on the rock increases proportionally with the weight being pulled down on the cam (making a solid placement).
Cams are also known as SLCD's, ""spring loaded camming devices"".Full Article \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Design and describe a hypothetical climbing situation where you would choose to use cams (SLCDs) as the primary protection. Consider the type of rock and climb you are on, and explain why cams would be the most effective choice.

Describe the climbing scenario, including the type of rock and the climb's characteristics.
Explain why you chose cams as the primary protection, and how they would be used in this situation.


### ANSWER:
I would use cams in a situation where I am climbing a large, vertical granite crack with parallel sides. Since the crack is too wide for a comfortable hand or foot placement and narrows down towards the top, cams would be the best option.cams are the best option on these type of climbs as the crack is too wide for other Climb protection and the camming nature of the Climb protection would be the best option as the narrows allow for no dolutional movement due to the crack narrowing.","### FEEDBACK:  Your response demonstrates a good understanding of the climbing scenario and the benefits of using cams in this situation. However, there are a couple of areas that need improvement.

Instead of saying 'cams are the best option on these type of climbs as the crack is too wide for other Climb protection', consider rephrasing it to 'cams are the best option on this type of climb because the crack is too wide for other protection methods, such as nuts or hexes, and the camming nature of cams allows for secure placement in parallel cracks.'
To make your response more concise and clear, consider breaking it up into two separate sentences. For example: 'I would use cams in a situation where I am climbing a large, vertical granite crack with parallel sides. This is because the crack is too wide for a comfortable hand or foot placement and narrows down towards the top, making cams the best option for secure placement.'"

The V Corps of the Grande Armée was a military unit during the Napoleonic Wars. The corps was originally formed in 1805 and was reorganized several times until it was discontinued in 1815.
In 1805–1807 the corps was constituted mainly of French troops, and was commanded by Marshals Jean Lannes, Édouard Mortier, François Joseph Lefebvre and André Masséna as well as Général de Division Anne Jean Marie René Savary.
In 1812, the V Corps was made up entirely of Polish soldiers from the Duchy of Warsaw under the command of General Józef Poniatowski. It was one of several non-French corps of the Grande Armée and at its peak consisted of around 36,000 soldiers. The corps took part in Napoleon’s invasion of Russia and fought in the Battle of Smolensk and the Battle of Borodino.
It suffered heavy casualties during winter retreat, but managed to reach Warsaw and later was reinforced with new recruits. In 1813, they went to Saxony, passing Bohemia. The corps was temporary disbanded with the remaining troops, and Poniatowski was reassinged to the VIII Corps.
After the disastrous Russian campaign, the V Corps was rebuilt in Magdeburg from newly formed French units in spring 1813. These troops were under command of General of Division Jacques Lauriston. Participating in the War of the Sixth Coalition the corps was disbanded again after Napoleon’s abdication.
In March 1815, V Corps was rebuilt again and placed under command of General of Division Jean Rapp. Ordered to defend the north-eastern frontier of France, it missed the Battle of Waterloo; instead winning the Battle of La Suffel.

Reformatory is a term that has had varied meanings within the penal system, depending on the jurisdiction and the era. It may refer to a youth detention center, or an adult correctional facility. The term is still in popular use for adult facilities throughout the United States, although most reformatories have been renamed correctional centers (or similar) in recent years.

So the journey to building a very simple table begins. This table is based on one from Thewoodwhisperer’s episode 11 arts and craft table. There’s is nothing fancy that’s done and that’s the best part for this primer on using SU.
Now I’ve spent some time putting the table together—unfortunately, I’ve still not figured out how to post it here. So if someone can enlighten me on that little gem I’d appreciate it.
Regardless – here we go. And remember – we are taking baby steps, trying to go methodically and get all, or at least as many as I can think of, the details in there. Hopefully this won’t be too boring but I’m doing this as much for myself as anyone. Hopefully it will help someone along the way.
First things first. Open SU and go to Window—Preferences—- highlight “templates” on the left hand list of items, then with the arrow drop down menu choose “inches woodworking 3d.”
This should give you a picture with three axes – those lines and a picture of a small framing square.
Select the framing square (click on it) – that will put a blue box around the frame—- hit delete on your keyboard – or right click and scroll up to erase.
So now you are left with the three axes. The red and green lines are the “ground” and the blue line is “up”.
Move your cursor to the upper left corner and select the rectangle icon—- this action will turn your cursor into a pencil with a small rectangle next to it.
Move the icon to the “origin” which is the point where all three axes come together. When your cursor hits the origin perfectly on center it will create a yellow dot. Using your mouse – left click to start drawing a rectangle.
Let go of the mouse after you click (we are going to avoid “dragging”), then move the mouse along the green axis. You’ll see your rectangle starting to take shape. You should also see a red line moving up along with your mouse. That red line means you are parallel to the red axis. You should also see a green line on the right which means you are parallel to the green axis.
Move your cursor about four inches up the green axis and then left click. This drops the end of the rectangle and it will turn the rectangle a dark blue color. This is the “face” or your rectangle.
Hit the “ESC” button on your keyboard to stop drawing rectangles.
Remember that anytime you make a mistake or want to undo anything, just go to Edit – drop down to “undo” and that will undo your last action. You can continue to “undo” as many times as you want. You can also undo the undo function—- ain’t that fun!
Take a look at the bottom right corner of your screen. The word “dimension” should be there and then a box with some numbers in it. Those numbers tell you how big your rectangle is. You can change that number, in fact you should. Type in 36,72 then hit the Enter button. This will size your table top to 36” deep and 72” long.
(If you drew your rectangle on the red axis you would type in 72,36.)
You do NOT have to put a space between the numbers 36 and 72—all you need is a comma. You can put in a space if you want to—- but you don’t need it. You DO need the comma. Don’t forget your comma!
Before we go any further, you should “save” your table so you don’t loose all your efforts.
Move your cursor up to the menu bar and select the push/pull tool. It’s the one that is square with an arrow coming out of it. (10th tool from the left).
Place the push/pull tool anywhere on the rectangle – just moving it over the rectangle will make a bunch of pretty little dots to show up. That means that your next action will effect that portion of your project. Move the tool off of the rectangle and it becomes a boring little box again.
Put the tool back over the rectangle and left click once – the pretty dots disappear – don’t let go off the left button and move your mouse up. This turns the rectangle white and gives it depth.
Take a look at the dimension box in the bottom right corner – you’ll notice that the numbers have changed from the rectangular dimensions to thickness. Type in .75 or 3/4 then hit Enter button. Then hit the “esc” button. Your rectangle is now a table top 3/4” thick and it should appear white on the screen.
OK. I have to take a break—- this left-handed typing is tough! More later tonight.
Remember I’ve still not figured out how to post it here. So if someone can enlighten me on that little gem I’d appreciate it. If you can tell me how—please do.

If you suffer from a peptic or duodenal ulcer, the last thing you might consider taking is hot Cayenne Pepper. This goes against everything you've ever heard about what aggravates an ulcer, the facts are that most ""spicy"" foods do just the opposite. Capsicum (Cayenne Pepper) can reduce pain which serves as a local anesthetic to ulcerated tissue in the stomach and can even help to control bleeding in the stomach.
Some individuals may be bothered by eating ""Red Pepper"" or spicy foods, these foods do not cause the formation of gastric ulcers in normal people. An interesting note is that people suffering from ulcers usually avoid Cayenne Pepper, in fact those people may actually benefit from its therapeutic action.
1) Taking Capsicum may significantly reduce the risk of ever developing a peptic ulcer. A Chinese study published in 1995 stated, ""Our data supports the hypothesis that the chile used has a protective effect against peptic ulcer disease.""
Another 1995 study found that Capsicum can even protect the stomach lining from aspirin induced ulcers.
2) Aspirin can cause stomach ulceration in certain individuals or if taken with too little water or juice. Researchers have concluded after experimenting with human volunteers that the capsaicin content of capsicum has a definite gastro - protective effect on the mucous membranes of the stomach.
3) Eighteen healthy volunteers with normal gastrointestinal mucosa took chile and water followed by 600 mg of aspirin and water. The study was conducted over a period of four weeks. Endoscopy results showed that taking 20 grams of chile before the aspirin definitely demonstrated a protective action on the stomach lining.
4) Capsicum has the ability to rebuild stomach tissue.
Capsicum has the ability to bring blood to regions of tissue at a faster rate boosts the assimilation of foods that are consumed with it.
5) Several clinical studies support this phenomenon. It has been thought that Capsicum stimulate the release of substances which increase secretions in the stomach and intestines plus can increase an abundance of blood to the stomach and intestines.6 In fact, Capsicum can increases the flow of digestive secretions from the salivary, gastric and intestinal glands.

Capsicum, commonly known as Cayenne Pepper, has several beneficial effects on the digestive system. Based on the provided text, create a short persuasive essay to convince someone suffering from a peptic or duodenal ulcer to consider incorporating Capsicum into their diet.

Clearly explain the common misconception about spicy foods and ulcers.
Discuss at least three scientific studies that support the therapeutic benefits of Capsicum for individuals with ulcers.
Emphasize the potential protective effects of Capsicum on the stomach lining and its ability to rebuild stomach tissue.


### ANSWER:
For years, individuals suffering from peptic or duodenal ulcers have been avoiding spicy foods, especially Capsicum, also known as Cayenne Pepper. However, recent studies have proven that Capsicum has several beneficial effects on the digestive system, making it an ideal ingredient to incorporate into one's diet. One common misconception is that spicy foods cause the formation of gastric ulcers in normal people, but research has shown that this is not true. In fact, studies have revealed that Capsicum can reduce pain, acting as a local anesthetic to ulcerated tissue in the stomach, and even control bleeding in the stomach. A Chinese study published in 1995 found that taking Capsicum can significantly reduce the risk of developing a peptic ulcer. Moreover, another study from the same year discovered that Capsicum has a protective effect on the stomach lining from aspirin-induced ulcers. An additional study involving human volunteers demonstrated that the capsaicin content of Capsicum has a definite gastro-protective effect on the mucous membranes of the stomach. These scientific studies prove that Capsicum is not only safe to consume for individuals with ulcers but also offers therapeutic benefits. Furthermore, Capsicum's ability to bring blood to regions of tissue at a faster rate and boost the assimilation of foods consumed with it can aid in rebuilding stomach tissue. With its pain-reducing properties, protective effects on the stomach lining, and ability to rebuild stomach tissue, incorporating Capsicum into one's diet can be a game-changer for those suffering from ulcers. So, don't be afraid to spice up your food with a dash of Cayenne Pepper – your stomach might just thank you.","### FEEDBACK:  Your essay effectively conveys the benefits of Capsicum for individuals with peptic or duodenal ulcers, and you have successfully incorporated the required information from the text. However, there are a couple of areas that need improvement.

To strengthen your argument, consider adding a clear thesis statement at the beginning of your essay. This will help to guide the reader through your argument and provide a clear direction for the rest of the essay.
While you have provided some specific examples from the text, it would be beneficial to include more specific details from the studies, such as the exact amounts of Capsicum used and the duration of the studies. This will help to add depth and credibility to your argument."

Osami Nagano was born in 1880. As a naval officer, he established a strong record in administration. He studied in the United States during the 1910s and was naval attaché to the US between 1920 and 1923. In Dec 1935, he represented Japan as the chief delegate at the Second London Naval Conference. Between May 1936 and Jun 1937 he was the Navy Minister under Prime Minister Koki Hirota. In Dec 1937, he was named commander in chief of the First Fleet and the Combined Fleet. From Apr 1941 to Feb 1944, he was chief of the Navy General Staff. Although he was a proponent of a southward expansion, he was against a war against the United States; he deduced that if even Japan was to take over British and Dutch colonies in Asia, the isolationist United States still would not enter the war against Japan, leaving Japan to establish her empire without the interference from the industrial giant. However, like he had done so a number of times before, he entrusted too much of strategic planning to Isoroku Yamamoto and his staff officers, essentially giving away control of the entire navy to the Combined Fleet. Yamamoto, although not a supporter of a war against the United States either, dutifully accepted his orders and led the Japanese Navy into the great attack at Pearl Harbor that brought the US into war. Nagano essentially lost real control of the navy after Pearl Harbor; Yamamoto had, in effect, gone as far as to tell Nagano ""not to interfere too much and thus set a bad precedent in the navy."" From Feb 1944 to the end of the war, he was Emperor Showa's personal naval advisor.
After the war, Nagano was among the highest ranked officers interrogated by United States naval officers. He was described as ""thoroughly cooperative"", ""keenly alert"", ""intelligent"", and ""anxious to develop American friendship"". He was subsequently tried as a war criminal, but died in 1947 before the trial ended.

Osami Nagano's Influence on Naval Strategy

Analyze the ways in which Osami Nagano's decision to give control to Isoroku Yamamoto and his staff officers ultimately affected Japan's involvement in World War II. Cite specific examples from the text to support your argument.


### ANSWER:
Osami Nagano's decision to give control to Isoroku Yamamoto and his staff officers significantly impacted Japan's involvement in World War II. By entrusting Yamamoto with strategic planning, Nagano essentially lost real control of the navy after Pearl Harbor, as stated in the text: 'Yamamoto had, in effect, gone as far as to tell Nagano 'not to interfere too much and thus set a bad precedent in the navy.' This led to Yamamoto leading the Japanese Navy into the attack at Pearl Harbor, which ultimately brought the US into the war. Additionally, Nagano's decision to trust Yamamoto allowed him to accept orders and plan the attack despite initial reservations against a war with the US.","### FEEDBACK:  Your analysis effectively highlights the significant impact of Osami Nagano's decision on Japan's involvement in World War II. However, to strengthen your argument, consider incorporating more specific details from the text, such as Nagano's role in the Second London Naval Conference and his views on a war with the US. Additionally, explore the consequences of Nagano's decision, including the shift in control within the Japanese Navy and the ultimate outcome of the war.

To address the first error, consider adding more specific examples from the text, such as Nagano's participation in the Second London Naval Conference and his views on a war with the US. This will provide a more nuanced understanding of Nagano's decision and its impact on Japan's involvement in World War II.

CDAA Position Statement – Water Fluoridation
Canadian Dental Assistants Association
The Canadian Dental Assistants Association (CDAA) firmly endorses the fluoridation of community water supplies as the safest, most important and cost-effective public health measure for reducing dental health disparities across Canada and maintaining oral health.
The CDAA supports the following:
- Establishment of a national plan for the use of fluoride administered through community water sources.
- Development of a national public health media campaign outlining the benefits of water fluoridation with a focus on 60 years of sound scientific research.
- Improving awareness and recognition of the pivotal role that oral health plays in overall general health and well-being.
- Increasing collaboration between dental practitioners and all levels of government, including municipal.
The CDAA recommends the following:
- Continuation of scientific research that evaluates the value, safety and efficacy of community water fluoridation.
- Participation of oral health practitioners in a leadership capacity in all activities related to the initiation or continuation of a community water supply program through collaboration with local governmental authorities.
- Continued, careful monitoring of existing fluoridated community water supplies to ensure that they remain within the Maximum Acceptable Concentration of 1.5mg/L, as per the Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality (2010), established by Health Canada.
Tooth decay is a serious public-health problem facing Canadians, which is largely preventable, yet it remains the number one chronic disease, among Canadians.3
According to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives,1 a combination of fluorides and dental sealants can prevent nearly all cavities, yet only 45% of Canadians live in communities with fluoridated water supplies.
Water fluoridation is the process of adding fluoride to a community’s water supply in order to ensure that its fluoride concentration level reaches a milligram per litre ratio that has been recommended by health industry practitioners, as ideal for maintaining oral health and preventing dental caries.
For over 60 years, the safety and efficacy of community water fluoridation has been researched and reviewed, resulting in a body of data of more than 3,000 published studies worldwide.
Some key conclusions of the scientific research include:
- Community water fluoridation is safe. The weight of evidence from all currently available studies does not support a link between exposure to fluoride in drinking water at 1.5mg/L and any adverse health effects.4
- Community water fluoridation is an effective public health method to reduce the occurrence of dental caries.4 The World Health Organization cites that the incidence of dental caries has increased and may further increase due in part to an inadequate exposure to fluorides.5
- Community water fluoridation is a public health measure that reduces oral health disparities across all socio-economic levels. People benefiting the most from water fluoridation are those most susceptible to tooth decay, namely the poorest and most disadvantaged members of society.2
- Monitoring of fluoridated community water supplies is required to ensure consistency in concentrations and to ensure the target fluoride level is applied at all times.4

The smoke from burning hair during a laser hair removal treatment could be bad for you and worst for those who are regularly exposed to the smoke as it contains chemicals that irritate the airways and are known to cause cancer, the Daily Mail reported.
Dr. Gary Chuang of the University of California, said, ""Laser hair removal performed by improperly trained personnel or in an inadequately equipped facility will put both the healthcare workers and patients at risk."" He added that the procedures should only be performed in spaces with an adequate air filtration system and a smoke evacuator.
‘The smoke from burning hair during a laser hair removal treatment contains chemicals that irritate the airways and are known to cause cancer.’
The team collected hair samples from two volunteers, sealed the samples in glass jars, treated them with a laser and captured 30 seconds of laser 'plume'. They identified 377 chemical compounds in the smoke, including 20 that are known environmental toxins, such as carbon monoxide, and 13 that are known or suspected to cause cancer.
The researchers conclude that the burning-hair plume released during laser hair treatment should be considered a 'biohazard, warranting the use of smoke evacuators, good ventilation, and respiratory protection'. The study is published in JAMA Dermatology \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Imagine you are a health inspector visiting a new laser hair removal clinic. Based on the article, what safety protocols should clinic owners have in place and why are they important?

Read the article and identify the main safety concerns associated with laser hair removal treatments.
Explain the importance of having a smoke evacuator and good ventilation in the clinic. Use scientific evidence from the article to support your argument.
Write a short memo to the clinic owners outlining the necessary safety protocols and explaining why they are crucial for protecting the health of clients and employees.


### ANSWER:
The clinic owners should have in place a smoke evacuator, good ventilation, and respiratory protection for employees. These safety protocols are important because the smoke from burning hair during laser hair removal contains 20 environmental toxins and 13 cancer-causing chemicals.","### FEEDBACK:  The clinic owners should have in place a smoke evacuator, good ventilation, and respiratory protection for employees. These safety protocols are important because the smoke from burning hair during laser hair removal contains 20 environmental toxins and 13 cancer-causing chemicals. The smoke evacuator is crucial as it can remove 99.9 percent of the smoke, reducing the risk of exposure to harmful chemicals. Additionally, the study found that the smoke contains 377 chemical compounds, including carbon monoxide, which is a known environmental toxin. By having a smoke evacuator and good ventilation, the clinic can minimize the risk of exposure to these harmful chemicals, protecting the health of clients and employees.

The answer still lacks a clear explanation of why these safety protocols are crucial for protecting the health of clients and employees.
The answer does not provide a clear explanation of the importance of having a smoke evacuator and good ventilation in the clinic."

Britain sent a peace mission to Bhutan in early 1864, in the wake of the recent conclusion of a civil war there, under Ashley Eden. The dzongpon of Punakha – who had emerged victorious – had broken with the central government and set up a rival Druk Desi while the legitimate druk desi sought the protection of the penlop of Paro and was later deposed. The British mission dealt alternately with the rival penlop of Paro and the penlop of Trongsa (the latter acted on behalf of the druk desi), but Bhutan rejected the peace and friendship treaty it offered. Britain declared war in November 1864. Bhutan had no regular army, and what forces existed were composed of dzong guards armed with matchlocks, bows and arrows, swords, knives, and catapults. Some of these dzong guards, carrying shields and wearing chainmail armor, engaged the well-equipped British forces.
The fort, known at the time as Dewangiri, at Deothang was dismantled by the British during 1865. The British initially suffered a humiliating defeat at Deothang and when they recaptured Dewangiri they destroyed much in an attempt to compensate.
The Duar War (1864–1865) lasted only five months and, despite some battlefield victories by Bhutanese forces, resulted in Bhutan's defeat, loss of part of its sovereign territory, and forced cession of formerly occupied territories. Under the terms of the Treaty of Sinchula, signed 11 November 1865, Bhutan ceded territories in the Assam Duars and Bengal Duars, as well as the 83 km² of territory of Dewangiri in southeastern Bhutan, in return for an annual subsidy of 50,000 rupees. The Treaty of Sinchula stood until 1910, when Bhutan and British India signed the Treaty of Punakha, effective until 1947.

Duars War and the Treaty of Sinchula

Write a reflective essay on the long-term consequences of the Duars War and the Treaty of Sinchula. Consider how these events shaped Bhutan's sovereignty, economy, and relations with British India. Be sure to include a short analysis of the effectiveness of the Treaty's terms, particularly regarding territorial concessions, British protection, and long-term peace between the two parties. Your essay should be approximately 250-300 words, with supporting evidence from the text and proper citations.


### ANSWER:
The Duars War and the Treaty of Sinchula had significant long-term consequences for Bhutan's sovereignty, economy, and relations with British India. The war, fought from 1864 to 1865, resulted in Bhutan's defeat and the loss of territory, including the Assam Duars and Bengal Duars, which were ceded to British India. This loss not only reduced Bhutan's territory but also significantly impacted its economy, as the Duars were a vital source of revenue for the kingdom. 


The Treaty of Sinchula, signed on November 11, 1865, marked the end of the war and established a new era of relations between Bhutan and British India. The treaty's terms included the cession of territories, British protection, and an annual subsidy of 50,000 rupees to Bhutan. While the treaty may have provided temporary stability and financial benefits to Bhutan, it ultimately compromised the kingdom's sovereignty and paved the way for British influence in the region. 

 The loss of territory and the annual subsidy, rather than a mutually beneficial agreement, can be seen as overly harsh and an early example of gunboat diplomacy in south Asia. An in-depth and multi perspective analysis in required to truly assess the effectiveness of the treaty, however the views of the Bhutanese perspective have been rarely studied and published in the views of the western historians. The treaty's effectiveness in maintaining long-term peace can be debated, as it was not able to handle conflicts in the views of both Bhutanese perspective,=3and British. ","### FEEDBACK:  The essay provides a good overview of the Duars War and the Treaty of Sinchula, but it lacks depth and analysis in certain areas. The writer could have explored the treaty's terms more thoroughly, examining the implications of the territorial concessions and the annual subsidy on Bhutan's sovereignty and economy. Additionally, the writer could have provided more context about the historical period in which the treaty was signed, discussing the broader geopolitical landscape and how it influenced the treaty's terms. 

The writer could have also benefited from a more nuanced analysis of the treaty's effectiveness in maintaining long-term peace. While the writer mentions that the treaty may have provided temporary stability, they could have explored the underlying factors that contributed to this stability and how they were sustained over time. Furthermore, the writer could have discussed the potential consequences of the treaty's terms on Bhutan's relations with British India and other regional powers."

In ""Sing to the Power,"" a Tapestry of Faith program
Tell the group:
Trying to take off too much at once will cause the bar of soap to break. Carving soap requires patience and persistence. Let's see how much of these ""water power"" qualities we have.
Make sure that participants' hands are dry before they touch their bar of soap; water will make the soap slippery and difficult to handle. Distribute bars of soap and invite the group to each think of an object or shape to carve. Encourage participants to come up with a plan before they start carving. Suggest that a fish or turtle shape tends to work well, as does a sun or a face.
Invite the children to use a pencil to lightly carve the desired shape into the surface of their bar of soap, and then use tools such as a table knife or screwdriver to gently carve the soap.
This activity lends itself to conversation. Use some discussion questions from Activity 1 to help the group continue processing the story, ""Phebe Hanaford Gets the Vote."" Or, invite participants to think about other social justice movements besides the women's suffrage movement in which people showed great persistence. For instance, during the Montgomery, Alabama bus boycott, protesters walked to work and school every day for over a year before they won the right to sit anywhere on the bus they chose.
Choose carving implements that are safe for all members of the group. Although some children this age are adept with a small kitchen knife, do not provide any utensils you think could challenge the dexterity or safe behavior of any group members.

### ANSWER:
I propose a community engagement project titled 'Empowering Education,' which aims to establish a literacy program for underprivileged youth in the local community.","### FEEDBACK:  
Your proposal for the 'Empowering Education' project demonstrates a clear understanding of the importance of literacy programs in empowering underprivileged youth. However, to strengthen your proposal, consider the following adjustments:

To address the issue of limited resources, research and incorporate potential funding sources, such as government grants, corporate sponsorships, or crowdfunding campaigns, into your project plan. Additionally, explore partnerships with local organizations or schools to access existing resources and expertise.
To ensure the project's long-term sustainability, develop a comprehensive plan for maintaining and expanding the literacy program. This could include strategies for recruiting and retaining volunteers, establishing a mentorship program, and creating a system for evaluating the program's effectiveness and making necessary adjustments."
