From their headwaters in the Sierra Nevada mountains, the Merced, Tuolumne and Stanislaus rivers were historically wild, teeming with salmon that sustained native Americans, early settlers, and abundant wildlife. These rivers join the lower San Joaquin River and flow into the Bay-Delta, one of the two main arteries that sustain the heart of the West Coast’s largest estuary. But for too long, California has allowed farmers and cities to divert massive amounts of water from the rivers that run through the heart of California’s San Joaquin Valley, leaving only a fraction of the natural flow in these rivers in the winter and spring months.
Decades of dam building, water diversions, and flood protection projects on these rivers have resulted in the vast majority of their flow being diverted each year. This has degraded water quality and has devastated the fish and wildlife -- and people, like sport and commercial salmon fishermen -- that depend on their health. Historically, hundreds of thousands of salmon returned each year to spawn in these rivers, but in recent years only a few thousand salmon have returned. Despite state and federal laws that set goals to “double” salmon populations to approximately 78,000 salmon returning each year, salmon populations have continued to decline in the San Joaquin basin.
The scientific information is clear that reduced flows, as a result of diverting most of the water from these rivers, is the primary (but not sole) cause of the continued decline, and that more flows are needed to restore salmon, the health of these rivers, and the health of the Bay-Delta estuary.
This summer, the State Water Resources Control Board will establish new flow standards to protect salmon and fisheries in the Lower San Joaquin River and the three tributaries. The Board’s draft report concludes that about 35% of the natural flow should remain in the rivers, allowing more than 65% to be diverted. Yet the scientific information shows that salmon are unlikely to recover at those flow levels, which are only slightly better than current flow levels.
We can – and must -- do better than 35% for San Joaquin salmon to recover and achieve the state and federal salmon doubling goal.
Diverting 65% of the Flow Won’t Restore California’s Magnificent Salmon
Scientists and fishery managers with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the State Water Resources Control Board, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and The Bay Institute, as well as independent scientific peer reviews and other conservation and fishing groups, have recognized that current flows are inadequate. For instance, in 2010, the State Water Resources Control Board concluded that the best available science showed that 60% of the natural flows should remain in the river in the spring months in order to achieve the salmon doubling requirement of state law and protect public trust resources (this was a non-binding conclusion). The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has also concluded that much higher spring flows in these tributaries and the lower San Joaquin River are necessary to recover salmon and achieve the salmon doubling requirement. Allowing the diversion of 65% of the water from would increase diversions on the Stanislaus River and isn’t even enough to meet minimum requirements under the Endangered Species Act on the Stanislaus River; if these flows are lower than what’s needed to avoid potential extinction, they obviously will not lead to recovery and salmon doubling. And independent scientific peer reviews of the Board's technical report last year endorsed the scientific analysis showing that higher flows are necessary to recover salmon and recommended consideration of higher flows than 60%, which is the upper end of the range that the State Water Resources Control Board is considering.
We Can Maintain Healthy Agricultural Economy and Healthy Rivers
The Board’s draft analysis shows that reducing diversions to increase river flows will still result in a robust agricultural economy; for instance, the Board found that allowing 40% of the flow down the river would result in a 1.5% reduction in agricultural revenue in the region. And this is likely a worst case scenario, as the Board’s analysis ignores the potential to increase agricultural water use efficiency to allow farmers to grow “more crop per drop” and increase profits, as well as water transfers between farmers and downstream exporters that could potentially help fund these improvements.
Increasing Flows in the River Benefits Lots of People, Too
Improving flows and restoring salmon has huge benefits for salmon fishermen, tackle shops, charter boats, fishing guides, and the thousands of jobs that depend on a healthy salmon fishery. Improved flows would improve water quality for Delta farmers and for cities and farms that get water exported from the Delta, and it is critical to restoring the health of the Delta. Allowing 65% of the water to be diverted in the basin leaves only a third for the rest of us.
Will California Restore the Health of the Low San Joaquin River and its Salmon?
The science is clear that more flows are needed than 35%, but the State Board is under pressure to adopt these weaker flow requirements despite the strong scientific evidence. In the coming weeks, fishermen, farmers, conservation groups, boaters, birdwatchers, scientists, and all of us will have a chance to tell the State Water Resources Control Board to do better to help ensure the future of California’s salmon. We can and should do better than 35%: is a third of a river really healthy? I hope you’ll join us in urging the Board to do better.

Imagine you are a decision-maker at the State Water Resources Control Board in California. Given the scientific evidence and the various perspectives presented, write a letter to the board explaining what percentage of the natural flow you think should remain in the rivers (Merced, Tuolumne, and Stanislaus) to protect salmon and fisheries in the Lower San Joaquin River and its tributaries.

In your letter, include at least three reasons to support your position and consider the perspectives of different stakeholders (e.g., farmers, fishermen, conservation groups).
approx. 250-300 words
Formal letter


### ANSWER:
Dear State Water Resources Control Board, I strongly believe that at least 60% of the natural flow should remain in the Merced, Tuolumne, and Stanislaus rivers to protect salmon and fisheries in the Lower San Joaquin River and its tributaries. Firstly, the scientific evidence presented by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and independent peer reviews clearly indicates that current flows are inadequate for salmon recovery. Secondly, reducing diversions to increase river flows will still result in a robust agricultural economy, with the Board's draft analysis showing only a 1.5% reduction in agricultural revenue in the region if 40% of the flow is allowed down the river. Additionally, improving flows and restoring salmon has huge benefits for salmon fishermen, tackle shops, charter boats, fishing guides, and the thousands of jobs that depend on a healthy salmon fishery. By prioritizing the health of our rivers and the communities that depend on them, we can ensure a sustainable future for California's salmon. Sincerely, [Your Name].","### FEEDBACK:  Your letter effectively conveys a clear position on the percentage of natural flow that should remain in the rivers, and you provide some good reasons to support your stance. However, there are a couple of areas that need improvement.

To strengthen your argument, consider including more specific data and statistics from the text, such as the percentage of natural flow that is currently diverted (65%) and the percentage that the State Water Resources Control Board is considering (35%). This will help to make your position more convincing and evidence-based.
To address the perspectives of different stakeholders, you could consider adding a sentence or two to acknowledge the concerns of farmers and the potential impact on the agricultural economy. For example, you could mention that while reducing diversions may have some impact on agriculture, the benefits of improved river health and salmon recovery will ultimately outweigh the costs. This will help to demonstrate that you have considered multiple perspectives and are not just focused on one stakeholder group."

Krishna (Sanskrit: कृष्ण) (kṛṣṇa in IAST, pronounced [ˈkr̩ʂɳə] literally ""dark, black"") is a central figure of Hinduism. He is known as the eighth and ""complete"" avatar of Lord Vishnu, come to restore Dharma to the earth in a time of great dharmic imbalance. Krishna is identified as a historical individual who participated in the events of the Mahabharata.
Krishna is often described as an infant or young boy playing a flute as in the Bhagavata Purana, or as a youthful prince giving direction and guidance as in the Bhagavad Gita. The stories of Krishna appear across a broad spectrum of Hindu philosophical and theological traditions. They portray him in various perspectives: a god-child, a prankster, a model lover, a divine hero and the Supreme Being. The principal scriptures discussing Krishna's story are the Mahabharata, the Harivamsa, the Bhagavata Purana and the Vishnu Purana.
Worship of a deity of Krishna, in the form of Vasudeva, Bala Krishna or Gopala, can be traced to as early as 4th century BC. Worship of Krishna as svayam bhagavan, or the Supreme Being, known as Krishnaism, arose in the Middle Ages in the context of the bhakti movement. From the 10th century AD, Krishna became a favorite subject in performing arts and regional traditions of devotion developed for forms of Krishna such as Jagannatha in Orissa, Vithoba in Maharashtra and Shrinathji in Rajasthan. Since the 1960s the worship of Krishna has also spread in the West, largely due to the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

So last week we were pelted with a terrible snow/ice storm the night before a physics test. Little did any of us know that it would put us out of school for four days (6 days when you count the weekend). As the students came back on Monday there was no way I expected them to be ready for their test. We both needed a few days to get back into the swing of things.
Enter mind mapping…
Both of my classes (regulars and honors physics) ate it up. I pitched them the idea (like a good salesman… I mean teacher has to do) and they got to work on mapping out their unit. Some drew creative pictures, some used circles, some squares, some even used different colors to help organize their materials. It was beautiful. I then broke them into groups of 2 or 3 and had them compare their mind maps. I encouraged them to check for accuracy, borrow things they liked from other maps, and continue to develop their review maps. We discussed visual learning and how some students are wired to be more visual. We tied it into our future education and how this is especially useful with larger amounts of material (college exams, finals). Not only did we get all of that from the 25 min activity, but they also reviewed their test material.
So was is mind mapping???
Mind mapping is a visual organization of material. It is taking notes in a graphical manner (per the Wikipedia article). It’s basically what I’ve always done on my napkin at my favorite coffee shop, but now I know the formal name. I never used this while I was growing up in school but had I known about it I would have used it all the time. The way I think about it is mind mapping takes all the papers on my constantly messy desk (different yet connected ideas) and places them neatly in the filing cabinet (some portion of my brain for storage and recall).
A quick google image search will provide you with a ton of examples.
If you are an educator or any sort, I highly recommend incorporating this idea into your classroom. The benefits will be two-fold. First your students will learn a new technique for learning. Secondly they will benefit from the review or organization of course material. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

VIRUS DISEASES OF ALLIUM SPECIES AND PROSPECTS FOR THEIR CONTROL
The potyviruses are the most important because they induce yellow striping which may result in large yield reductions. Their transmission takes place efficiently by various aphid species when briefly probing on plants. These viruses and their host-specific strains are usually limited to a single Allium species. Onion yellow dwarf virus (OYDV) is known from onion (A. cepa) and shallot (A. cepa var. ascalonicum) in the USA and Europe. Shallot crops in Asia were found to be infested by the new shallot yellow stripe virus (SYSV). Work at the Lembang Horticultural Research Institute in Lembang, Indonesia, showed that OYDV is now spreading in Java. Leek yellow stripe virus (LYSV) occurs in leek (A. ampeloprasum var. porrum) in Europe and in pearl onion (A. ampeloprasum var. sectivum) in Indonesia. Garlic strains of OYDV (OYDV-G) and of LYSV (LYSV-G) affect garlic (A. sativum) worldwide. Striping in Welsh onion (A. fistulosum) is due to the new Welsh onion yellow stripe virus (WoYSV), which probably also causes the virus disease reported in Japan in rakkyo (A. chinense).
Control of OYDV in shallot crops and of OYDV-G in garlic crops in some European countries is by strict certification of bulbs for planting, but this is expensive and requires a well-functioning inspection service. Shallot and garlic crops in other countries often contain some plants not infected by potyvirus or not showing symptoms of potyvirus infection. Such plants may carry genetic resistance or may be cross-protected by a mild virus strain. Propagation and distribution of planting stock from healthy plants selected in the field or obtained by resistance breeding seem promising for improving yields of vegetatively propagated allium crops in the tropics. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Assess the potential effectiveness of using cross-protection by a mild virus strain to control the spread of potyviruses in Allium species

Explain the cross-protection mechanism and how it can be applied to control potyviruses in Allium crops
Discuss the advantages and limitations of cross-protection compared to other control methods such as strict certification of bulbs for planting and resistance breeding
Propose a research plan to investigate the feasibility of using cross-protection to control potyviruses in a specific Allium species such as onion or garlic
Consider the potential economic and environmental impacts of implementing cross-protection as a control method for potyviruses in Allium crops


### ANSWER:
Cross-protection by a mild virus strain can be an effective method to control the spread of potyviruses in Allium species, as it can provide genetic resistance to the crop and reduce the severity of symptoms. This method involves infecting the crop with a mild strain of the virus, which triggers a defense response that protects the plant against infection by more severe strains. To apply cross-protection, farmers can propagate and distribute planting stock from healthy plants selected in the field or obtained by resistance breeding. Cross-protection has several advantages, including being a cost-effective and environmentally friendly method, as it reduces the need for pesticides and other chemicals. However, it also has some limitations, such as the risk of the mild strain mutating into a more severe strain, and the potential for the protected plants to still transmit the virus to other plants. A research plan to investigate the feasibility of using cross-protection to control potyviruses in onion or garlic could involve conducting field trials to assess the effectiveness of cross-protection in reducing the severity of symptoms and improving yields, as well as conducting laboratory tests to identify the most effective mild virus strains for use in cross-protection. Implementing cross-protection as a control method for potyviruses in Allium crops could have significant economic and environmental impacts, including reducing the economic losses associated with potyvirus infections and decreasing the environmental impact of pesticide use. ","### FEEDBACK:  Your response provides a good overview of the potential effectiveness of using cross-protection by a mild virus strain to control the spread of potyviruses in Allium species. However, there are a few areas that need improvement.

You mentioned that cross-protection can provide genetic resistance to the crop, but this is not entirely accurate. Cross-protection is a temporary measure that provides protection against severe strains of the virus, but it does not provide genetic resistance to the crop. The crop remains susceptible to the virus, but the mild strain triggers a defense response that protects the plant against infection by more severe strains.

What causes morning sickness in pregnancy?
As many pregnant women know, the bouts of nausea and vomiting that are commonly called ""morning sickness"" can happen any time of day. An estimated 60 to 80 percent of women experience this symptom of early pregnancy, which may be caused by hormonal changes and can be aggravated by stress or fatigue. For most women, the nausea and vomiting fade by the 17th week of pregnancy. In rare cases, a pregnant woman will experience morning sickness well past this point. Even more rare is hyperemesis gravidarum, a very severe form of morning sickness that prevents a pregnant woman from keeping in the fluids or nutrition she needs. This condition requires medical treatment. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

Severe hyperemesis gravidarum among pregnant women in the workforce could lead to lost productivity due to extended absences and health complications. This reduction in workforce can result in a significant societal burdan but might not necessarly lead to large scale economic downturn. To mitigate this impact, employers could offer flexible work arrangements such as telecommuting and pre-maternity leaves. Getting the best medical care is ultimately the goal, health insurances can cover some or all cost of treatments. Governments could also provide social support programs for families affected by hyperemesis gravidarum. Ensuring that pregnant women have access to proper medical care can significantly reduce cases of severe hyperemesis gravidarum.","### FEEDBACK:  Your essay provides a good start in discussing the potential consequences of severe hyperemesis gravidarum among pregnant women in the workforce.

One of the most common childhood fears is the fear of the dark. However, being scared of the dark is not so exclusive to children anymore. In fact, a new study presented at the Associated Professional Sleep Societies annual meeting suggests for the first time that an underlying fear of the dark might be one of the causes of insomnia. Insomniacs or those with sleeping problems might want to pay attention to this sleep study. If you can’t fall asleep without a nightlight, you might want to pay attention to this potential discovery of a new form of insomnia treatment.
What is Insomnia?
Put simply, insomnia is the inability to sleep. There is acute, or short-term, insomnia and chronic, or long-term, insomnia. Acute insomnia may be caused by something situational, like stress at work or financially. Chronic insomnia lasts for over a month, and is often indicative of another problem. If you think you may suffer of insomnia or have before, don’t worry, you’re not alone. Actually, victims of insomnia are the majority. More than 50 percent of Americans have reported having sleeping problems in the past year. There are medicines you can take for insomnia, but clearly, there’s still some problems to work on for those with sleep trouble.
New Study on Insomnia and Darkness
In this new sleep study, the Associated Professional Sleep Societies gathered 93 individuals, both good sleepers and bad, with an average age of 22 and with 73 percent of them being women. A survey they took of the participants showed that 46 percent of the bad sleepers said they had some fears of the dark, as opposed to the 26 percent of good sleepers. They tested this survey with a study using eye-blink latency, and what they found only confirmed what was reported in the survey.
Does Darkness Cause Insomnia?Poor sleepers experienced a decrease in eyeblink latency when exposed to noise and good sleepers experienced an increase. What that means the noises startled the poor sleepers than the good sleepers, and the good sleepers were better able to accommodate to the noises. Researchers figured this out by monitoring small twitches in the eye muscles, and the bumps in the night startled the poor sleepers much more. This goes to show that those who have to sleep with the TV on or with the bathroom light on and have trouble sleeping may be able to put two and two together. Their fear of the dark could be leading to their insomnia.
How to Sleep Better: There's Hope for Insomniacs!
In the past, insomnia has often been fought with the use of drugs and home remedies. For some, this has worked, but others still suffer from sleep deprevation. This may offer the simple treatment of a phobia, which will in turn cure their insomnia. This non-drug therapy may prove to be a major achievement in those looking for help with their sleeping problems.
46 percent of poor sleepers who are afraid of the dark is not a small number, and could be a big leap in sleep studies. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

I chose the space shuttle. The space shuttle has a reusable orbiter with three main components. The first component is a reusable orbiter, made of aluminum alloys to reduce weight and increase strength. The second component is the external fuel tank, made of foam-covered steel for increased stiffness and uniqueness. The final component is the solid rocket booster, made of steel to carry the thrust forces. To modify the space shuttle for a trip to Mars, I propose lengthening the external fuel tank and increasing the thrust by 50. This will allow the rocket to fly higher and longer and give the increased interplanetary travel uniqueness.

Analyzing the Structure of Life of Pi

Choose one of the three parts from Life of Pi and explain how the events within that part contribute to the overall themes of the novel. Be sure to include specific examples and textual evidence to support your argument.


### ANSWER:
In Part Two of Life of Pi, the events within this part contribute to the overall themes of the novel, specifically the theme of survival and the human condition. For instance, when Pi is stranded on the lifeboat with the tiger, he must find a way to coexist with the animal in order to survive. This is evident when Pi says, 'I was to survive at sea with the company of a 450-pound Bengal tiger', emphasizing the importance of adaptability in the face of adversity. However, I forgot to mention that this theme is also closely tied to the idea of hope and resilience, which is a crucial aspect of the novel but I havent given enough textual evidence to prove it. Additionally Pi is reintroducing species since its Passenger pigeon species which densities very High area survival rate simply breeding without predator.: ","### FEEDBACK:  You have provided a good analysis of the theme of survival in Part Two of Life of Pi, but there are a few areas that need improvement.

You mentioned the theme of hope and resilience, but you did not provide enough textual evidence to support this claim. Consider adding more quotes or examples from the novel to strengthen your argument.
You mentioned the reintroduction of species, but this is not directly related to the theme of survival in Part Two. Instead, focus on how the events in this part contribute to the overall themes of the novel, such as the human condition and the struggle for survival."

Poem writing requires talent and inspiration. True poets can easily find the necessary words and rhymes for expressing their inner state. People who are not experienced in this activity cannot do it quickly and easily. In fact, it does not matter what level you are at the moment. Writing poems is a skill that can and must be developed. A novice poet needs to know that there are certain criteria for evaluating poetry works. First of all, there must be a new idea, a thought expressed in a poetic form. Second, it is necessary to determine the balance of form and content and strictly observe it in the poetic work. In any language, there are rules that must be adhered to, especially for novice authors. A young poet may not master the language, but the clarity of presentation and literacy is the minimum that a beginner must possess for the reader to understand him or her.
How to Start a Poem Creation
Anyone can learn how to write poetry. First and foremost, if you want to learn how to do it, you should hone not only your writing skills. Any grammatical inaccuracy in poetry is much more remarkable than in prose. How can you improve your literacy? There is a very simple way; you need to read well-written books. The daily reading of poetry will become a powerful impulse for you and your creativity. This is a very important stage. You will feel how after reading your favorite works you begin to speak poetry. Try to alternate classics and contemporary authors. Being acquainted with different styles and forms will increase your writing skills.
Life Experience and Poems
Do not be afraid to be sincere in your poems. Lyrical poems are usually devoted to close people, nature, different memories, etc. In order to understand the importance of human heat, to see the nuances of nature’s beauty, you need to have great life experience. Lyrical poetry is most often created by writers at a young age.
Philosophy can be represented in poetry only as a kind of creativity of the authors who have passed a certain age boundary. Philosophy is not an area of energetic boys and young girls, but an area of elders who are taught by their lives.
Tips for Writing a Poem
To become a good poet, you need to know a few more things that are important. Not all people have talent, and not every writer can become a genius. However, each person can learn how to create interesting and non-trivial verses.
The first thing you need to know about poetry is its basic elements, namely, rhyme and rhythm. These features make it possible to distinguish poetry from prose. There are many different kinds of rhymes. You can easily find their examples on the Internet. You need to practice creating different combinations of words constantly until you can write them easily and quickly.
The use of this or that rhyme should be meaningful, do not use too trivial rhymes. The main principle of any creativity is its novelty. That is why this kind of activity is called creativity, i.e., creating something new and not copying other people’s ideas.
Look for Interesting Images
The main task of the author is to tell about simple things in interesting words. Learn to express your thoughts through images. Look for inspiration. For example, pay attention to the nature around you. However, be careful; do not try to use the metaphors of famous poets in your works.
More poems are devoted to one theme, love. Of course, there are real masterpieces among them. However, not many novice writers will be able to create something similar to the works of Shakespeare. Try to show your originality. Look for new, non-trivial topics from social life and philosophy.
Think of the Plot
If you write a small poem, the presence of a clear plot is not necessary. However, if you are mulling over creating a large work (for example, a novel in verse), you need to find an interesting and exciting plot. It is also necessary to remember how important the structure of the text is. Use different literary techniques to make your poem attractive to readers. For example, you can present the events of your novel in the form of a retrospective and use interesting metaphors, etc.
Do not Write Poetry for the Sake of Glory
Many writers were unknown during their lifetime and did not count on world fame, so you also do not need to hope that your first poem will be recognized as a genius masterpiece. Do not force yourself to write something; you must feel inspiration. It may appear unexpectedly, but at the same time, you can create such an atmosphere that can increase the chances of inspiration awakening. Walk, visit interesting places, travel around the world.
In order to become a good author, you need to practice. However, this does not mean that you need to publish or show your every work. Do not be graphomaniac. Today many young people consider themselves to be successful poets and publish several similar and uninteresting works per day in their blogs. Many classics of literature waited for inspiration for years to create masterpieces, remember this.
Do not Be Afraid to Change the Structure of the Poem
Very often, poets are faced with a problem when it is very difficult to find a suitable word. In this case, it is worthwhile to think about changing the structure of the entire poem. Creating a good work can take a long time. Do not be afraid to experiment and try different options. If you find it hard to concentrate on a thought, you need to rest. Read your poem the next day; perhaps a fresh mind will help you discover inaccuracies and errors that you have not noticed before. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

And Seaburg adds, ""If you have a chronic illness or take prescription medications and you are evacuated or choose to go to a community center, make someone aware that you have a medical condition, so they will know what to check for if your behavior seems a little unusual.""
Another consideration during a loss of power is for patients with chronic breathing problems.
People who require continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, devices for sleep apnea or other sleep issues will need an alternative source of power. There are options available for most machines, including CPAP battery packs, DC power options, marine battery adapters and travel-specific CPAP machines to provide power in the event of an electrical outage.
Keeping food at a healthy temperature may be a challenge during a power loss.
Refrigerators keep dairy products, meat, fish, poultry and eggs at a healthy temperature if they are 40 degrees Fahrenheit or below, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. If your power goes out, your refrigerator will stay at the proper temperature for about four hours if it's unopened. Placing ice bags or dry ice will help to maintain healthy cooling.
A full freezer will remain cool for about 48 hours, or for about 24 hours if half full. It's a good idea to have digital thermometers on hand to check the temperature.
Once the thermometer goes above the recommended temperature, avoid eating any dairy products, meat, fish, poultry or eggs. Throw away items that have been compromised.
The USDA suggests keeping a supply of canned and packaged foods that do not require refrigeration. Coolers are a good solution if your power will be on within 24 hours. And knowing where to purchase ice and dry ice is a good way to plan for an emergency. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

### ANSWER:
Announcer: Are you prepared for a power outage? Consider two essential things to stay safe and healthy. If you have a chronic illness or take prescription medications, inform someone of your condition in case you need assistance. Keep a list of your medications and medical equipment, such as a CPAP machine, and have a backup power source available. Also, keep a first aid kit and a week's supply of medications on hand. When it comes to food, keep your refrigerator and freezer doors closed to maintain the temperature. A full freezer will keep food safe for 48 hours, while a refrigerator will keep food safe for 4 hours if unopened. Use ice packs or dry ice to keep your food cool. And consider purchasing a digital thermometer to ensure your food is at a safe temperature.

While not very appetizing to discover when you crack open a fresh egg, blood spots are not harmful.
According to the American Egg Board, blood spots are “occasionally found on an egg yolk. These tiny spots do not indicate a fertilized egg. Instead, they are caused by the rupture of a blood vessel on the yolk surface during formation of the egg or by a similar accident in the wall of the oviduct.
Mass candling methods reveal most eggs with blood and those eggs are removed. However, even with mass scanners, it’s impossible to catch them all.”

This poster was created with the understanding that many people of european heritage might say we believe and honor our ancestors, but often times that belief is really just a concept or superficial wishing. It might sound cool to say in certain circles, but is it really something that is alive inside of us?
If we truly believe in our ancestors, then our behavior will honor that belief. Our ancestors have many stories and understandings to teach us, but only if we can slow down enough and open our hearts to listening. This spacious listening is most often found in nature – most importantly the nature of our ancestral home places. Get back there!
Superficial tokenizing of our own ancestral cultures and stories, disrespectful “borrowing” (stealing) of other Indigenous cultures, and beliefs of futurism and technological salvation are just a few behaviors we engage in that too often dishonor the key understandings our ancestors still hold for us, and the pathways they can offer to step backwards into the future. What is new is old, and what is old is new again. Our ancestors deserve to be honored for their great love and sacrifice they have made so we still have a chance to turn towards life to find wholeness and balance once again. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

A gentle breeze rustled through the leaves, carrying with it the story of 'Mitakuye Oyasin,' a Lakota phrase that translates to 'we are all related.' I spent the day contemplating these words, recognizing the intricate web of life that connects me to the land, my people, and every living being.","### FEEDBACK:  Your narrative effectively transports the reader to the ancestral homeland and conveys a sense of reverence for the land and the ancestors. However, there are a couple of areas for improvement.

To strengthen the narrative, consider adding more sensory details to help the reader immerse themselves in the experience. For example, what did the air smell like? What sounds did you hear? What did the trees look like? By incorporating more sensory details, you can create a more vivid and engaging story.
To make the narrative more personal and reflective, consider adding more introspection and self-awareness. How did the experience of learning about 'Mitakuye Oyasin' change your perspective on your relationship with your ancestors and the world around you?

Living in space should be an amazing challenge, but however practical and (relatively) easy to create will be spaceships and habitats, there is nothing above a genuine planet to live on. Besides, it’s much safer during those galactic wars than fragile space bases, where a single hit can leave you grasping for air… or maybe not, considering planets cannot escape. But I digress.
If we ever rise into space, and find planets close enough to ours, then, no doubt, our kind will seek to change them to our own image, and make them habitable.
This is a collection of ideas around the concept of terraforming. Which of them are likely to be used will depend on the level of technology, and too many other factors.
Additional thoughts are welcome. Please try to keep the format (major themes as scroll comments, lesser topics as replies).
And sorry for the broken outside links. :|
Additional Ideas (10)
Whenever the requirement of stability is mentioned, you should also consider the proper timescale, as compared to the human lifespan. Geological and astronomical phenomena can take LONG. If a planet becomes uninhabitable after ten thousands years, it is perfectly fine for settling down now! Even centuries may be okay.
Changing the kinetic properties of a planet is not an easy task, though more a question of raw power than of intricate knowledge. A typical method would be bombarding it with directed comets and asteroids, giving it little pushes at the right moments (and handily depositing organic substances, incidentally heating up the atmosphere a little).
But this is not only a matter of how long you prefer your day, or year to be! Distant planets receive less sunlight, closer ones more; a too distorted elliptic orbit may cause extreme shifts in temperatures over the year, and require intervention. Day and night mean variations as well, so they need to be balanced similarly.
Checking rare constellations is not always astrology.
For planet-based life, an atmosphere is a most handy place to deposit the waste, and find basic nourishment. As everything diffuses in it fast, basically any lifeform from the surface can be expected to interact with the atmosphere to some degree. It is therefore of key importance to have this part covered.
Small planets may have none to speak of, so a weak adaptation would be to make an atmosphere that is sufficient to allow people to carry masks instead of vacuum suit. A breathable air, though, is something different. If lacking the gravity to hold its air, some parts or all parts may over time ""evaporate"" into space. Especially hydrogen is susceptible here, this is suspected to what happened to Mars - water would decompose in the upper layers of atmosphere, the hydrogen leaving, oxygen staying to be eventually bound to other chemicals.
Still, small planets may be designed with this risk taken into account, renewing the composition of gases regularly. (Consider stability.)
- as a flavour element, a different atmosphere may indeed taste differently. It may also have a different color (that depends on the sun(s) as well).
- even little differences count sometimes; imagine diseases spreading well on some worlds while little on others; or aliens attacking a given human-colonized planet for no apparent reason, as they happen to like a certain type of air.
The ability of human lungs to extract oxygen from the air is dependent on a concept called 'partial pressure'. Partial pressure is the amount of total pressure dependent on one given component of the atmosphere. Humans require about 3 pounds per square inch of oxygen, and an atmosphere of less than 0.02 psi Carbon dioxide. The balance can be composed of nearly any substantially inert gas. Explorers and terraformers must display some caution however, as high partial pressures of inert gas may cause a kind of intoxication, known as nitrogen narcosis. Excessive oxygen (>7psi partial), meanwhile, is a powerful poison.
To a large part, the temperature of astronomical bodies considered here will be determined by the activity of their sun - and what happens with the radiation on/around the planet itself.
An important term is Albedo, the reflective ratio of electromagnetic radiation power; simply put, white surface reflects light (high albedo), while dark surface absorbs it (low). For our purposes, we can extend this beyond the visible parts of the spectrum.
The albedo of a planet can be influenced by the atmosphere itself (and the clouds). And these three in turn can be influenced by the biosphere once it has sufficient impact - so select the initial flora carefully, to avoid complications.
But let's reconsider this from the main point of view: Life, as we are used to it, requires a thin range of temperatures to prosper in. Life in general can be expected to be much more robust.
The frictional heating of a moon's interior due to flexure caused by the gravitational pull of its parent planet and possibly neighboring satellites. The most dramatic example in the Sol system is the tidal heating induced in each of the four Galilean satellites by their mutual pull and, more significantly, by the powerful attraction of Jupiter. In the case of Io, the result is global volcanism. In the case of Europa, and perhaps also of Ganymede and Callisto, the effects of tidal heating are less dramatic but possibly much more profound in that they give rise to a suspected under-ice ocean which might conceivably support life.
For a comfortable living, the surface should be mostly stable, as intense tectonic activity can spoil anyone's day. From the initial and unstable periods of a planet's existence, this activity can be expected to lessen over time, as a homogeneous body forms and the internal heat with radiation cool down. (Moons) and other interstellar bodies disrupt this tendency towards piece.
According to some theories, tectonic plates we know on Earth are caused by life as well. The slow, but relentless processing and transporting of some materials, and the frugal deposition of others (a classical example are corals), keep exerting pressure on parts of the Earth's crust. Given enough time on the (geological scale), this may drive the tectonics of a whole world.
This doesn't even start on the topic of surface itself, ie geography. There can be 'young' worlds with many extremes, and strongly eroded 'old' worlds. There can be worlds mostly covered by oceans, or purely desert worlds. Anything is possible.
Particularly moons and smaller planets don't have the 1G we are used to (future sensitivities in this regard may vary, of course). A way to imbue these bodies with larger gravity is to shrink them (see http://crowlspace.com/?p=70). With strong gravitational/electromagnetic/something fields could be a planet compressed to higher density, and the same weight with a smaller radius has just the required result.
How this process would exactly work, and what difficulties it would bring, I leave to the reader's imagination.
Credit goes to crowlspace.com
While all of this is hypothetical, the role of our own moon is to many scientists vital, if not critical for our environment. On the one side, it probably helps keeping the core of Earth in rotation, thus enabling a strong magnetic field which is also deemed important. On the other hand, there is the immeasurable impact on our oceans.
Note that our moon is relatively large when compared to our planet. The effect of a smaller moon or several is likely to be different.
Life, when in sufficient amount, will influence or dominate a planet's weather, and determine things like temperature, humidity and surface composition. Where such a complex system will evolve may be hard to tell - it may very well grow beyond the plans of its creators, and beyond their control, though not necessarily to the detriment of life in general.
The same is true for the composition of the atmosphere, so care should be taken to pick the right fauna and flora, and if needed change it to achieve the necessary dynamic stability.
The proper science for the study of these effects may be geophysiology, more popularly known as the Gaia theory. Life, it claims, has a tendency to support itself.
So what happens if new, transplanted life starts to prosper, and meets the older, local lifeform suddenly thriving in the changed environment?
- life - where applicable, organisms, probably genetically engineered or altered, will tackle on the task of converting the geosphere into a biosphere, see also Ecopoiesis.
Although effective, and good at creating an initial store of organic compounds for the later, more advanced biosphere, this can take VERY LONG, picture hundreds or thousands of years. Races with a sufficient lifespan or foresight may seed this way numerous planets for later use - and be quite annoyed when they come to their new home only to see it was 'discovered' by somebody else!
Even if other methods are used, it is useful to start planting useful plants as a planet becomes more and more habitable. Making the planet alive will take time.
- chemistry - making the problem one of the right catalysts, all is needed is a massive reactor to supply energy, and the time for the brute-force approach to get the job done.
- nanotechnologies - a potentially very viable option, to let tiny machines do the work for you. This may be easy, but watch for the chance of their 'mutation', or getting out of control like with the lifeforms. (Most likely they will have to multiply on their own to cover a whole planet, so tiny flaws could be replicated...) It is suggested to make them of limited duration to naturally pass away once their purpose is fulfilled.
The Firefly setting, as cool as it is, rests on one very unrealistic assumption: dozens of planets and moons fitting for life exist in a single solar system. But for the sake of storytelling, we can't let ourselves limit with something that is merely 'improbable', can we?
By the way, most stars appear to be members of double star or triple star, or even double-double star systems.
A theoretical alternative to have more planets in a good location, is to have several on one orbit. (See the Klemperer rosettes for more info.)
Both of the above cases should be rare. While they are thought to be quite stable, a question is if they can arise naturally, during the formation of a solar system.
Their presence, therefore, may indicate a massive astrophysical intervention of an advanced civilization. So, ideal as they may be for settling, be careful around them.
Per the setting material in the games and the novels, all these planets were terraformed by the Central Worlds not that long ago (by means not explained). They then litterally threw people at these worlds to syphon off excess population.
One source is the Worlds and Planets scroll, some examples will follow.
These planets may have the size, and even atmosphere, but they are not orbiting any sun, in fact they are not gravitationally bound to any star, and move through space on their own. Without a sun to warm them up, they are likely to be dead, frozen places. However, there are theories how even such a dark world could maintain and keep relatively high temperatures, high enough for life as we know it.
(See the Wikipedia entry for more information.)
- A Black Dwarf (a very hypotetical body) would be cold enough, but probably would have to loose on weight to be habitably.
- Losing weight is easy also for other bodies (like brown dwarfs, large objects too cold to be stars), if there is something sufficiently large nearby - like, say, another star. Stripped of the outer layers, what remains could be a planet, of possibly quite an exotic mix. (Don't ask me how to terraform that, though. ;) ) \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

The first method involves introducing microorganisms that can convert the existing gases into a more breathable atmosphere, such as oxygen. The second method involves using nanotechnology to break down or build up gases, such as using nanobots to remove excess carbon dioxide or add oxygen to the atmosphere. The advantages of the first method include its potential to create a stable and self-sustaining atmosphere, while the second method offers more precision and control over the atmospheric composition. However, the first method may take longer to produce results and may be more susceptible to unforeseen consequences, such as the microorganisms altering the atmosphere in unintended ways. The second method, on the other hand, may be more expensive and may require more advanced technology. Additionally, both methods carry the risk of unintended consequences, such as the microorganisms or nanobots altering the atmosphere in ways that are harmful to human life or the planet's ecosystem. Furthermore, the scientists must consider the partial pressure of the gases, the albedo of the planet, and the impact of the biosphere on the planet's environment to ensure a stable and habitable atmosphere.

The total cost of the car should be $10,000 (principal) + $3,000 (interest) = $13,000, but you should have also considered the monthly payments and how they affect your budget.
In your reflection, try to be more specific about how borrowing money affects your feelings about the purchase. For example, you could describe how the monthly payments might impact your ability to save for other expenses or how the total cost might make you feel more or less committed to the purchase."

One of the best ways to understand what changed between the Old and New Testaments, between the Old and New Covenants, is to explore, study, and evaluate what exactly Jesus did when He ushered in the kingdom of God. We often comprehend the meaning of Jesus’ first advent totally around His substitutionary death on the cross. But we cannot separate Jesus’ delivery of a new covenant, a new arrangement with God that was made true by His death and resurrection from His broad description of initiating the kingdom of God on earth. The two are inseparable. When we accept the new arrangement with God that Jesus wrought on the cross as our substitute, when we embrace the gospel message of Jesus Christ, we become citizens of His kingdom immediately in the here and now.
Jesus began His earthly ministry with this proclamation, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.” (Mk 1:15). That Jesus announced the kingdom of God has arrived should be of no surprise to us looking back since we believe that Jesus is indeed the Messiah King promised as the one to come by various Old Testament prophets. However, in real time 30 AD, it soon became apparent that Jesus was not fulfilling the Old Testament prophecy as His contemporaries expected. Their familiarity with kings and kingdoms involved political and military might, subjection of populations, and ruling with power. Since Jesus avoided these power structures altogether, what kind of kingdom could He be proclaiming? And what is its nature? One of the more perplexing aspects of Jesus’ kingdom is its secret nature. This nature is brought into sharper focus as we investigate the Old and New Testament timeline in the announcement of the new kingdom; the kingdom of God, the kingdom of heaven, the kingdom of His beloved Son as it is variously called.
In the Old Testament, proclamation was made loud and clear that a Messiah is coming. And this Messiah carries with Him a strong political significance. Quoting the “Messiah” entry in The Zondervan Pictorial Bible Dictionary, we read, “[The Messiah] is to destroy the world powers in an act of judgment, deliver Israel from her enemies, and restore her as a nation. The Messiah is the King of this future kingdom to whose political and religious domination the other nations will yield. His mission is the redemption of Israel and His dominion is universal. This is the clear picture of the Messiah in practically all of the Old Testament passages which refer to Him.”
In essence, The Messiah was to come with power and bring deliverance, judgment, and restoration. His future coming was called “the Day of the Lord,” and this proclamation, taking various forms and spokesmen, is a prominent theme throughout the Old Testament. Joel 1:15, 2:1,11,31, 3:14, Amos 5:18, Zeph. 1:14-16, and Mal. 4:1,5 use this phrase – the Day of the Lord – with various adjectives such as great, awesome, and terrible. The summary of the Old Testament prophecies regarding the Messiah King is that He would appear at the great and awesome Day of the Lord.
With this background of Old Testament prophecy regarding the nature of the Messiah’s coming, we will continue our timeline next post with the arrival of the last of the “Old Testament” prophets; John the Baptist. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Imagine that you are a Jewish person living in 30 AD, expecting the arrival of the Messiah King to fulfill the Old Testament prophecies. However, Jesus arrives with a message that is different from what you expected. Write a journal entry expressing your thoughts, feelings, and questions about Jesus' proclamation of the kingdom of God.

Describe your preconceived notions about the Messiah King based on the Old Testament prophecies.
Explain how Jesus' message of the kingdom of God challenges or confirms these notions.
Raise questions or concerns that you have about Jesus' kingdom, given its seemingly'secret' nature and lack of emphasis on political power and military might.


### ANSWER:
March 30, 30 AD - Jerusalem","### FEEDBACK:  Your journal entry provides a good starting point for exploring the expectations and questions of a Jewish person living in 30 AD. However, there are a few areas that need improvement.

To make your journal entry more authentic, consider adding more sensory details about the setting and atmosphere of Jerusalem during this time period. This could include descriptions of the sights, sounds, and smells of the city, as well as the emotions and reactions of the people around you.
To better capture the complexity of your thoughts and feelings, try to incorporate more nuanced and introspective language. Instead of simply stating that Jesus' message is 'different' from what you expected, explore the specific ways in which it challenges or confirms your preconceived notions. What aspects of his message resonate with you, and what aspects seem foreign or unsettling?
To make your questions more specific and thought-provoking, try to focus on the unique aspects of Jesus' kingdom that you find most puzzling or intriguing. For example, you might ask about the nature of Jesus' authority, the role of faith in his kingdom, or the relationship between his kingdom and the Old Testament prophecies."

Modern surgical techniques have come a long way in recent years. Fiber optics allow ear surgeons to perform delicate operations that would have been unheard of just decades ago. One of the most common procedures is known as myringotomy (MERE-IN-JOT-OH-ME), an operation that involves making a small hole in the eardrum and passing a tube through to drain excess fluid from the middle ear. It's particularly useful in treating children with ear infections. While many hearing disorders can be treated with antibiotics or other drugs, surgery may still be necessary in extreme cases. Most ear surgery is now considered to be both simple and safe. See an ear, nose and throat specialist when you detect the first sign of hearing loss, dizzy spells or other symptoms of ear ailments. If surgery is necessary, the doctor will explain the procedure. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Hearing Aids and Ear Surgery

Imagine you are an ear, nose and throat specialist. Write a short informative letter to a concerned parent of a child diagnosed with an ear infection that may require a myringotomy. Briefly explain the procedure, its benefits, and the reasons why surgery might be necessary. Use the information from the reading and your own knowledge to make the letter both clear and reassuring.


### ANSWER:
Dear [Parent's Name], I am writing to inform you that your child has been diagnosed with an ear infection that may require surgical intervention. The procedure, known as myringotomy, involves making a small hole in the eardrum and passing a tube through to drain excess fluid from the middle ear. This is a common and safe operation that can greatly alleviate your child's discomfort and promote healing. If left untreated, the infection can lead to further complications, including hearing loss and speech development issues. The benefits of the procedure far outweigh the risks, as it will allow your child to recover fully and avoid long-term damage. Rest assured that I will be with you and your child every step of the way to explain the process and answer any questions you may have.","### FEEDBACK:  The letter is clear and informative, but there are a few areas that need improvement.

The letter does not mention the use of fiber optics in the myringotomy procedure, which is a key aspect of modern ear surgery. Consider adding a sentence to explain how fiber optics are used to make the operation more precise and less invasive.
The letter does not provide any information about the recovery process or what to expect after the surgery. Consider adding a sentence or two to reassure the parent that the recovery process is usually quick and that the child will be able to return to normal activities soon after the surgery."

Australasian Journal of Victorian Studies, Vol 15, No 2 (2010)
In 1869, the Victorian naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace—co-founder with Darwin of the evolutionary theory of natural selection—published an account of the eight years he had spent in the Malay Archipelago. Just five years beforehand, in 1864, Wallace delivered a paper to the Anthropological Society of London, in which he declared that “the same great law of ‘the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life’” was resulting in “the inevitable extinction of all those low and mentally undeveloped populations with which Europeans come in contact”. The 1864 and 1867 documents paint a sinister scenario indeed, casting interracial relations as an “unequal” and violent “struggle for existence” between the superior European races and the non-European races, whose mental, moral, and physical degradation doomed them to extinction. Representative of prevailing scientific opinions at the time, these observations stand in sharp contrast to The Malay Archipelago’s observations of happy and harmonious interracial relations in the archipelago, not to mention its praise of the physical and moral attributes of the “savages” there.
For the humans of Wallace’s archipelago, life appears to be as Edenic as the natural environment they inhabit. The question I would like to address here is, why did Wallace emphasize the virtuous qualities of the very races he had described as lowly in almost every respect? And why did he concentrate on the interracial harmony in the region rather than the deadly interracial struggle he expressed belief in only a few years before? \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Critical Analysis: Wallace's Altering Perspective

Analyze the disparities in Alfred Russel Wallace's depiction of non-European populations between his 1864 paper and his 1869 publication of The Malay Archipelago, and argue whether his altered perspective represents a genuine shift in his scientific opinion or a literary device to promote a particular worldview.


### ANSWER:
Wallace's altered perspective represents a genuine shift in his scientific opinion, as evidenced by his nuanced observations of interracial harmony in The Malay Archipelago, which challenge his initial declarations of the inevitable extinction of non-European populations due to their perceived mental and physical inferiority.","### FEEDBACK:  Your analysis demonstrates a clear understanding of the disparities in Wallace's depiction of non-European populations, but could be strengthened by a more nuanced exploration of the historical context and potential motivations behind his altered perspective.

To further develop your argument, consider incorporating primary sources from the time period, such as other scientific papers or contemporary accounts of interracial relations in the Malay Archipelago, to contextualize Wallace's observations and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the prevailing attitudes towards non-European populations.
Additionally, examine the potential influence of Wallace's personal experiences and interactions with non-European populations during his travels on his scientific opinions, and how these experiences may have contributed to his altered perspective in The Malay Archipelago."

Researcher Doris Jones has unearthed startling new evidence demonstrating that fluoride interferes with enzyme systems, damaging many organ systems of the body.
The fluoride issue, a perennial hot potato, is heating up once again. In Britain, the government has recently announced its intention to fluoridate the water of deprived inner city areas, supposedly to improve the dental health of children living there. Later, water fluoridation may be introduced nationwide. A White Paper outlining the government's plans is scheduled for this spring.
The government and the dental profession have convinced the public that fluoridated water offers nothing but benefits that there is overwhelming evidence that it prevents tooth decay and contributes to the strength of bones. There is tacit admission in the pro fluoride camp that fluoride can also cause harm, but only at high levels: more than 2 ppm in water may cause mottled teeth and over 8 ppm may lead to bone disorders and degenerative changes in the vital organs.
A few lone voices have countered the prevailing view, with published evidence that fluoride can have devastating effects, causing mottled teeth and osteoporosis at very low levels. While much has been written about the effects of too much fluoride on teeth and bones, little is known about the effects of fluoride on the rest of the body.
But new evidence has emerged demonstrating that it can have devastating effects on just about every organ in the body, and may even be partly responsible for behavioural problems like hyperactivity and many puzzling illnesses like ME.
Like mercury, fluoride isn't exactly an obvious choice for dental health as it is a poison more poisonous than lead and only slightly less poisonous than arsenic (Clin Toxicol Commerc Prod, 1984; 11: 4, 112, 129, 138). It's been used as a pesticide, and it's a component in fungicides, rodenticides, anaesthetics and many drugs. The fluoride used in toothpaste, mouth rinses and dental gels is usually sodium fluoride, a waste product from the aluminium industry. Fluoride added to our water supply is hydrofluorosilic acid or sometimes silicofluoride waste products of fertiliser and glass industries.
The late US fluoride critic George L Waldbott discovered that, besides teeth and bones, fluoride can damage soft tissue. According to his research, the small fluorine ion with a high charge density can penetrate every cell of the body and combine with other ions (GL Waldbott et al, Fluoride: The Great Dilemma, Lawrence, Kansas: Corenado Press, 1978: 148-74). It interferes with the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus and the function of the parathyroid glands.
It has a strong affinity to calcium, but will also readily combine with magnesium and manganese ions and so can interfere with many enzyme systems that require these minerals. The interruption of these enzyme systems, in turn, may disturb carbohydrate metabolism, bone formation and muscle function. Indeed, every vital function in the body depends on enzymes; because fluoride easily reaches every organ, many diverse toxic symptoms can result.
Fluoride and enzymes
Enzyme systems react to fluoride in different ways; some are activated, others are inhibited. Lipase (essential for the digestion of fat) and phosphatases (needed to breakdown phosphates) are very sensitive to fluoride. In patients with skeletal fluorosis, succinate dehydrogenase activity is inhibited. In chronic fluoride poisoning, this diminished enzyme activity accounts for muscular weakness and even muscle wasting. Human salivary acid phosphatase is diminished by half when exposed to 3.8 ppm of fluoride. The blood enzyme cholinesterase is inhibited by 61 per cent on exposure to 0.95 ppm fluoride an amount within recommended levels adversely affecting functions of the nervous system (PA Smith, ed, Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology, Berlin: Springer Verlag, 1970: 48-97). \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Imagine you are a team of researchers conducting an experiment on the effects of fluoride on human health.

Choose an enzyme system mentioned in the article and design a study to investigate how varying levels of fluoride exposure impact its activity and related bodily functions.


### ANSWER:
We will investigate the effects of fluoride on cholinesterase enzyme activity. Cholinesterase is responsible for the breakdown of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in the nervous system. We will design a study with three groups of 100 participants, each exposed to different levels of fluoride: 0.5 ppm, 2 ppm and 8 ppm. Participants blood cholinesterase levels will be measured before and after fluoride exposure. Additionally, participants will complete cognitive and motor function tests to assess the impact of fluoride on the nervous system.","### FEEDBACK:  Your study design is a good start, but it needs more details and consideration of potential limitations.

You should specify the duration of the study and the frequency of cholinesterase level measurements to ensure accurate results.
Consider adding a control group that is not exposed to fluoride to compare the results and determine the impact of fluoride on cholinesterase activity.
You should also consider the potential confounding variables, such as age, sex, and pre-existing health conditions, and how they will be controlled for in the study."

Support for the appeal of protective measures against the airborne spread of Covid-19
A publication by Lidia Morawska and Donald K. Milton in the journal ""Clinical Infectious Diseases"" (CID) published on Monday appeals for attention to the role of airborne microdroplets and aerosols in the spread of Covid-19.
239 scientists from 32 countries have signed the paper entitled ""It is time to Adress Airborne Transmission of COVID-19"" as supporters (1). One of these supporters of the appeal is Professor Hartmut Herrmann, head of the Atmospheric Chemistry Department (ACD) at the Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research (TROPOS).
The Morawska and Milton Declaration addresses the medical community and the responsible national and international authorities, not least the WHO. It clearly emphasizes that the protective measures recommended so far against the infection and spread of Covid-19 viruses should be supplemented everywhere by ventilation and air exchange measures, as otherwise these do not provide sufficient protection against transmission by floating microdroplets or droplet nuclei.
Depending on the particle size, one distinguishes droplets (larger than 5 µm) from smaller particles (droplet nuclei or infectious aerosols, smaller than 5 µm). The transformation is fluent; droplet nuclei can be generated from droplet size particles by drying out in the air (2).
Especially the WHO (Worlds Health Organisation) or also the American health authority CDC do not sufficiently warn of the danger of the long-lived infectious particles floating in the air, according to the author and the supporters.
The German Robert Koch Institute (RKI) confirms: ""Longer time spent in small, poorly ventilated or unventilated rooms can increase the probability of infection by aerosols even over a distance of more than 2 m (...). An effective air exchange can reduce the aerosol concentration in a room"". (2)
Also in Germany, where at present public life is gradually returning and many institutions are reopening, we must consider whether the recommendations take sufficient account of the aspect of airborne infectious particles and, if necessary, adjust measures accordingly. A possible renunciation of the wearing of masks should therefore be based on caution and carefulness and does not appear to be appropriate at the moment.
The statement by Lidia Morowska and Donald K. Milton includes concrete recommendations for implementation:
- Provide sufficient and effective ventilation (supply clean outdoor air, minimize recirculating air) particularly in public buildings, workplace environments, schools, hospitals, and aged care homes.
- Supplement general ventilation with airborne infection controls such as local exhaust, high efficiency air filtration, and germicidal ultraviolet lights.
- Avoid overcrowding, particularly in public transport and public buildings
Prof. Herrmann and the Director of TROPOS, Prof. Macke, and thus TROPOS as a whole, support the appeal that the aerosol aspect should not be ignored in the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

Critically evaluate the implications of the Morawska and Milton Declaration on the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in regards to airborne transmission and ventilation measures in public spaces.

In your response, consider the recommendations outlined in the declaration, the stance of international health authorities such as the WHO, and the potential consequences of neglecting the aerosol aspect of virus transmission.


### ANSWER:
The Morawska and Milton Declaration highlights the significance of airborne transmission in the spread of COVID-19, emphasizing the need for enhanced ventilation measures in public spaces. The declaration's recommendations, which include sufficient ventilation, avoidance of overcrowding, and supplementation with airborne infection controls, are critical in mitigating the transmission of the virus. However, the WHO's stance on airborne transmission remains conservative, contradicting the declaration's findings. Neglecting the aerosol aspect of virus transmission could lead to increased infections, particularly in poorly ventilated spaces. Therefore, it is essential to reassess and revise existing guidelines to prioritize ventilation measures and minimize the risk of airborne transmission.","### FEEDBACK:  The response provides a good overview of the implications of the Morawska and Milton Declaration, but lacks depth and supporting evidence. To strengthen the argument, consider incorporating specific examples of successful ventilation measures in public spaces, such as the use of HEPA filters or UV-C lighting. Additionally, provide more nuanced analysis of the WHO's stance on airborne transmission, including potential reasons for their conservative approach and the potential consequences of this approach on global pandemic response.

What is the Difference in Profit per Acre between Organic and Conventional Coffee?
AbstractThe research addresses the economic problem of deforestation. A contributing factor to deforestation is coffee production. Coffee is an indigenous plant that is naturally occurring in the native tropical forests. However, conventional coffee is grown on cleared forest soil. In the native forest there is the potential for additional fruits (bananas, mangoes, avocados) and wood products while in the conventional coffee production system the only product is coffee. Conventional coffee production often causes deforestation and soil erosion while the organic coffee production system does not. In addition, the price risk associated with the coffee monoculture is high and has proven disastrous to the sustainability of coffee production in past years. Thus, determining the comparative cost and return between the two methods can provide important information for coffee producers. The purpose of the research is to determine the per acre profitability between conventional and organic coffee. This will be determined by researching the distribution of quantity on representative plots. This will help identify any size or scale economies. Determining the difference in profit per acre between organic and conventional coffee production included identifying and working with production stakeholders, engaging in fieldwork, site and case study selection, and determining measurable, non-market benefits and costs that pertain to environmental and community factors. This included, but is not limited to fertilization, water, pesticide use, and timber harvest.

LAWSUIT TO BE FILED TO PROTECT GREEN STURGEON
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: February 20, 2003
Conservation organizations formally notified the Bush Administration of their intent to initiate legal action to protect the green sturgeon, challenging its January 29, 2003 determination not to list the ancient fish species under the Endangered Species Act. The notice of intent to sue was filed by the Environmental Protection Information Center (EPIC), Center for Biological Diversity (CBD), and the Oregon Natural Resources Council (ONRC).
The decision came from the U.S. Department of Commerce's NOAA Fisheries (formally known as the National Marine Fisheries Service) more than seven months overdue, and was only issued after conservation organizations sued the agency to force it to make a determination. The organizations initially filed a scientific petition to list the green sturgeon in June 2001, documenting precipitous declines in this fish species that has survived more than 200 million years.
Conservationists strongly dispute NOAA Fisheries'
determination that the green sturgeon ""neither appears to be declining
in population numbers or are in danger of extinction."" Only three
river systems are known to support green sturgeon today, in the Klamath-Trinity,
Sacramento, and Rogue Rivers, with the species divided into at least two
distinct populations that apparently do not interbreed. Each population
is believed to consist of only a few hundred female fish of breeding age,
The greenish-gold, bony fish look prehistoric, with a skeleton consisting of mostly cartilage and rows of bony plates for scales. They have snouts like shovels and mouths like vacuum cleaners that are used to siphon shrimp and other food from the sandy depths. The green sturgeon, unlike most other species of sturgeon, spawns in cold water and gravel habitat similar to what is required for salmon and steelhead trout.
""Siltation from clearcut logging, de-watering of rivers, and agricultural and land development have largely eliminated the deep holes and river habitat that green sturgeon require,"" Jeff Miller of CBD said. ""The same severe water quality and quantity problems that have impacted salmon in the Pacific Northwest have also decimated green sturgeon,"" Miller added.
In marine waters, the green sturgeon ranges from Mexico to Alaska and it feeds in estuaries and bays from Monterey Bay to British Columbia. A number of spawning populations of green sturgeon in California have been presumed lost since the 1960s and 1970s - in the Eel River, South Fork Trinity River, and San Joaquin River. Severe declines of green sturgeon have been noted recently in northern rivers that may have once had spawning populations, including the Umpqua River in Oregon and the Fraser River in Canada.
""Many scientists have come to believe that the Klamath-Trinity river system is the center of the universe for green sturgeon. In a major fish kill on the Klamath River in late September 2002, a few green sturgeon were also reported among the various fish species that made up 5% of the fish kill that overall destroyed at least 33,000 chinook salmon,"" said Wendell Wood, Southern Oregon Field Representative for ONRC.
In October, a federal biologist with the (then) National Marine Fisheries Service went public with accusations that the administration had ignored his findings that increased water flows were essential to protecting salmon listed under the Endangered Species Act. ""Conservationists are concerned about a developing pattern of Bush Administration interference that has withheld significant scientific recommendations as well as economic reports demonstrating the major economic and ecological importance of the Klamath River,"" Wood said.
More information about the green sturgeon, a copy of the listing petition, and color photos of the species are available on the EPIC website at www.wildcalifornia.org, the CBD web site at . An illustration of the green sturgeon is available courtesy of NOAA at www.psmfc.org/habitat/edu_gsturg_image.html.
More Information on Green Sturgeon
Sturgeon are modern relicts of the ancient group of bony fishes, and have a skeleton that is mostly cartilage rather than bone and rows of bony plates for protection instead of scales. The sturgeon has a shovel-like snout and vacuum cleaner-like mouth that it uses to siphon food.
Green sturgeon spend a lot of time in river estuaries and in the ocean, moving upstream mostly to spawn. A few spawning sites have been identified, mostly on the Klamath River. One pool on the Klamath is known to be particularly active. Leaping and jostling fish crowd into a place called ""The Sturgeon Hole,"" about a mile upstream from Orleans, California, in spring and early summer. To a lesser degree, spawning also occurs in the Sacramento River, especially in one of its tributaries, the Feather River, and in the Rogue River in southern Oregon.
Green sturgeon spawn in the freshwater of only a few large rivers, all of which have diversions, dams, and sediment problems that limit sufficient water flow and suitable spawning conditions. The San Francisco Bay population of green sturgeon has been estimated to fluctuate between 500 and 1000 adult fish in the last few decades. While the exact size of the Klamath Basin green sturgeon population is unknown, it is likely the largest spawning population. It is believed that the spawning population in the Eel River (south of Eureka, CA) disappeared by the 1970s, although a few adult sturgeon have been found upstream in recent years.
In addition to habitat destruction, historic over-fishing was a major cause of decline of the green sturgeon - present fisheries probably continue to deplete a stock of large, old fish that cannot renew itself at present harvest rates. Sturgeons are highly vulnerable to over-fishing because of the long time it takes them to reach breeding maturity, and their infrequent reproductive success. Their large size and sluggish nature make them easy to net and snag.
Until recently, various West Coast fisheries were harvesting at least 6,000 to 11,000 green sturgeon per year. In recent years, the annual harvest has been estimated at 3,000 to 5,000 adult fish. More restrictive sturgeon size limit fishing regulations have been gradually implemented in California, Oregon, and Washington - mainly aimed to protect the larger and more common white sturgeon, but which allow many of the large breeding-age green sturgeon to be caught.
In North America only seven sturgeon species may now remain.
Until recently, eight species of sturgeon occurred in North America--four of which (plus one population of the white sturgeon) are already listed as endangered or threatened; the Shortnose sturgeon, Gulf sturgeon, Pallid sturgeon, Alabama sturgeon, and the Kootenai River population of the white sturgeon.
On September 17, 2002, the last known Alabama sturgeon, a male named ""bubba,"" died in a state fish hatchery. The Alabama sturgeon was formerly widespread throughout 1,000 miles of the Mobile River Basin of Alabama and Mississippi. While hope remains that a few wild Alabama sturgeon may still be found somewhere in the Cahaba and Alabama Rivers, intensive fish surveys and widespread recreational fishing have failed to find any since 1999. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

News Report: Rip Current Safety

Imagine you are a local news reporter assigned to cover rip current safety at your area's most popular beach. Write a 250-word article discussing the dangers of rip currents, how to recognize them, and what steps to take if you get caught in one.
Include at least three water safety tips from the provided text in your article.
Use a clear and concise tone, and assume your audience has little knowledge of rip current safety.


### ANSWER:
Rip Current Safety: Know the Risks and Learn to React. As summer heats up, beachgoers flock to our shores, but with the fun comes a hidden danger: rip currents. These powerful channels of water can quickly pull swimmers away from the shore, leaving them exhausted and at risk of drowning. To recognize a rip current, look for discolored or foamy water, a lack of breaking waves, or a channel of churning water. If you get caught in a rip current, stay calm and don't try to swim against it. Instead, swim parallel to the shore until you're out of the current, then swim back to shore. Always swim near a lifeguard and never swim alone. Weak or inexperienced swimmers should also wear a U.S. Coast Guard-approved life jacket. By being aware of the risks and knowing how to react, you can have a safe and enjoyable beach experience.","### FEEDBACK: 249 words, clear and concise tone, includes three water safety tips

The article is well-written and effectively conveys the dangers of rip currents and how to react if caught in one.

Morning sickness refers to a state or feelings of nausea, vomiting or sickness during the early part of pregnancy which occurs especially in the morning. Why is it called morning sickness? Simply because, it is a feeling of sickness; and it starts at the beginning of the day (not necessarily). For most women the signs appear during the start of the day but goes away as the day progresses, while some other may feel it either at the later part of the day or even the whole day.
It does not happen to all women in pregnancy. It may happen to some and not to others. According to an estimate, about 3 quarters of women feel morning sickness during the first three months of their pregnancy.
The earliest time it starts is normally four weeks or five weeks and in some cases as late as six weeks. All women do not experience the same starting time, or length. Some may feel it as early as four weeks, while other may start the feeling even after the 6th week. However, the majority of women get the nausea and vomiting feeling just about the first four weeks.
How long does morning sickness last?
There is no exact answer to that. Some women would get relief just about in two weeks after its appearance, while other may feel better in about 5 to 9 weeks, some around 14 weeks and some even later than that. Generally speaking, around 50% of pregnant women find themselves relieved from morning sickness by 14th week. While some other may take even a month or so longer. In a few other cases, it may become more severe, in which case, it is called as hyperemesis gracidarum. Such excessive cases of nausea and vomiting has been observed in a very small group of women which may lead to weight loss and dehydration because of the lack of absorption of food and liquids in to the body in the right amount.
Causes of Morning Sickness
What causes it? Who gets it? Why certain women get it and others don’t? There are no exact and scientific answers to these questions. There are some studies which have probed into the matter and have come up only with some general observations.
Some of the reports indicate that Morning Sickness, most probably, occurs because of the changing levels of the hormones after a woman conceives. The hormones level rise above the normal level enabling the body to cope with the new situations.
But again, the question remains why the hormone level rise in some women during their pregnancy and not in others? It is not known exactly. It may be due to the overall psychical makeup of the body, health condition, the immune system and other factors. So, the general observation is that some women get more morning sickness than others, without exactly knowing the underlying causes or reasons behind it.
Typically speaking, there are a couple of causes which are generally associated with nausea and vomiting during pregnancy without any clear scientific evidence. For example, women with twins or more babies have more chances to suffer from morning sickness than the women pregnant with only one baby. This could be because of the production of high levels of hormones in their bodies such as, HCG, estrogens etc. Also those women who used to take birth control pills before they were pregnant have more chances to suffer than the ones who did not. Women who have a family history are likely to suffer more than those who not. In other words, genetic factor is responsible to a certain extent for causing nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.
What about the relationship of morning sickness with a baby girl or a baby boy? Does it have an effect in case of gender of the baby? There, certainly, have been debates regarding this issue i.e. what is the effect of the morning sickness on women carrying a boy and on women carrying a girl. According to a study, it was found that those women who were pregnant with baby girls were 50 percent higher than those pregnant with boys.
There is another issue, much less debatable, that women having miscarriages have no or low morning sickness as compared to those who have successful pregnancies. The logic or reason behind this is that women with miscarriages do not have the babies or placenta developing and, as such, have lower levels of hormones. As there system does not require a high level of hormones so they do not have the feeling of nausea or vomiting.
On the other hand, women who have successful pregnancies have the babies or placenta developing in them and hence their body needs a high level of hormones. This may be true to some extent. However, that does not mean that a successful pregnancy is definitely related to morning sickness as there are a lot many women out there who delivered quite well without feeling sick or vomiting while they were pregnant.
How to Ease?
What are the ways that can ease or relieve morning sickness? Are there any? Yes, there are! In most cases, doctors and midwives will not prescribe any medication as long as they see it as a normal part of pregnancy. However, there are some very useful and easy steps which if followed can get one a good relief. In case of more severe cases, one should always speak to the doctor and act upon the advice that is recommended by him or her. Here a couple of steps which may help to reduce morning sickness.
1) Change eating habits. That means to eat smaller bits during the day rather than one large meal.
2) Avoid the stomach either being completely full or empty.
3) Take a good rest during the day.
4) Avoid smelling places like kitchen.
5) Substitute the nausea and vomiting causing food with the ones that don’t trigger morning sickness.
6) Consider using acupressure or motion sickness bands.
Morning Sickness Frequently Asked Questions
1) What is Morning Sickness?
A general definition of Morning Sickness would be a state or a feeling of nausea and vomiting in the early part of pregnancy especially during the morning.
2) When does morning sickness start?
Answer: No fixed time. It may start early as well as late. Round from first to the 6th week is the normal time. Few women have seen it as early as the 1st week.
3) How long does morning sickness last?
Answer: It may last a few days or a few weeks. Generally, goes away after 4 weeks.
4) What does morning sickness feel like?
Answer: It feels like you are motion sick. You simply feel sick, vomiting or nausea.
5) When does morning sickness end?
Answer: No exact end times. Generally improvement starts after the first few weeks. In some rare cases may last up to 14 weeks or even later.
6) What causes morning sickness?
Answer: No exact cause known. It may be due to the rising levels of hormones. Common triggers are spicy or sharp smelling food, empty stomach or being too full at one time.
7) When do you get morning sickness?
Answer: It has been associated with pregnancy. Any sickness other than pregnancy is generally not referred to as morning sickness. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon participated in the first live, televised debate as a part of the campaign of 1960. Those who watched the telecast thought Kennedy had won, largely because he looked calm, physically in control, and attractive, whereas Nixon had a 5 o'clock shadow and appeared nervous. Those who listened to the debate on the radio thought Nixon had won.
Because of its ability to reach so many people, television had an impact on American culture-even more so than writers like Ayn Rand could. It was a way of connecting one part of the country to the other, thus minimizing cultural and regional differences. Television was an avenue for bringing the nation together. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Analyze the impact of the 1960 presidential debate on American politics and society.

Discuss how the debate's unique attribute of being the first live, televised debate influenced viewers' perceptions of the candidates, and how this event reflected the broader cultural significance of television in 1960s America, using supporting evidence from the text.


### ANSWER:
The 1960 presidential debate between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon signified a pivotal moment in American politics and society. The debate's live, televised format influenced viewers' perceptions, as those who watched on television perceived Kennedy as the winner due to his calm and attractive appearance, whereas radio listeners thought Nixon won. This disparity highlights the differential impact of visual versus auditory information on public opinion. The debate also underscored television's capacity to connect the country, diminish regional differences, and unite the nation. This broader cultural significance of television was exemplified in its ability to transcend geographical boundaries and introduce a new level of intimacy with the candidates, which had a lasting impact on American politics and culture.","### FEEDBACK:  The analysis provides a good overview of the debate's impact on American politics and society, but could be strengthened by more nuanced discussion of the cultural significance of television in 1960s America.

To improve, consider exploring how the debate's televised format reflected the broader cultural context of the 1960s, such as the rise of television as a dominant medium and its influence on American culture.
Additionally, provide more specific examples from the text to support the argument, such as the quote about television's ability to 'connect one part of the country to the other' and'minimizing cultural and regional differences.'"

Royal Niger CompanyFlag of the Royal Niger Company
Sir George Taubman Goldie conceived the idea of adding to the British empire the then little known regions of the lower and middle Niger River, and for over twenty years his efforts were devoted to the realization of this conception. The method by which he determined to work was the revival of government by chartered companies within the empire, a method supposed to be buried with the British East India Company. The first step was to combine all British commercial interests in the Niger, and this he accomplished in 1879 when the United African Company was formed. In 1881 Goldie sought a charter from Gladstone's government but his attempts failed.
At this time French traders, encouraged by Léon Gambetta, established themselves on the lower river, thus rendering it difficult for the company to obtain territorial rights; but the Frenchmen were bought out in 1884, so that at the Berlin Conference on West Africa in 1885, Goldie, present as an expert on matters relating to the river, was able to announce that on the lower Niger the British flag alone flew. Meantime the Niger coast line had been placed under British protection. Over 400 political treaties drawn up by Goldie were made with the chiefs of the lower Niger and the Hausa states. The scruples of the British government being overcome, a charter was at length granted (July 1886), the National African Company becoming the Royal Niger Company, with Henry Austin Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare as governor and Goldie as vice-governor.
It was, however, evidently impossible for a chartered company to hold its own against the state-supported protectorates of France and Germany, and in consequence, on January 1, 1900, the Royal Niger Company transferred its territories to the British government for the sum of £865,000. The ceded territory together with the small Niger Coast Protectorate, already under imperial control, was formed into the two protectorates of northern and southern Nigeria.

How did the French traders' presence on the lower Niger River initially affect the Royal Niger Company's ability to obtain territorial rights and how was the issue resolved?
What long-term impact did the formation of the Royal Niger Company have on the development of colonial West Africa and Nigeria specifically?


### ANSWER:
The Royal Niger Company significantly contributed to the British Empire's expansion in West Africa by reviving the concept of government by chartered companies, combining British commercial interests in the Niger, and obtaining territorial rights through treaties.","### FEEDBACK:  The Royal Niger Company significantly contributed to the British Empire's expansion in West Africa by reviving the concept of government by chartered companies, combining British commercial interests in the Niger, and obtaining territorial rights through treaties. Sir George Taubman Goldie's efforts to revive the concept of government by chartered companies were successful, as he was able to obtain a charter for the Royal Niger Company in 1886.

The Lenape call themselves the Lenni Lenape, which means ""original people."" There are three divisions of the tribe.
Their flag carries many symbols that reflect their culture. The mask in the center of the flag represents Mesingw, the ""Masked Spirit"", who is the guardian of the creatures of the forest. The forest animals were as important to the Lenape as the buffalo were to the natives of the plains.
European settlers pushed the nation from Delaware through 16 states, including Ontario, to Oklahoma where many of them live today.
They used copper to make pipes and ornaments. These were traded along with pottery, dressed deerskin, beads, and feather mantels. They used their pottery to store corn, beans and tobacco, which they grew along with sweet potatoes and squash.
Dyes from certain vegetables and minerals were used for picture writing to record history and communicate and to paint themselves for ceremonies and battle.
In the beginning, the nation was at ease with the new settlers, but when the settlers began to take what was theirs, the warriors took action. The Lenni Lenape Historical Society and Museum has records of these events.

Recently I was going over my notes for my classes on the indigenous civilizations that flourished in Latin America before the arrival of the Europeans. I had two points on both the Aztezs of Mexico and the Incas of Peru: legend and history.
I became intrigued by my separation of these two “realities” and wondered why they shouldn’t be one and the same. Perhaps it is because we look at the “historical” as provable facts and “legend” as not being scientific. The more I thought about it, the more it occurred to me that our separation of these two realities stems from western dualism; the separation of body and soul. The historical is from the brain, or the intellect, while the legendary is from the soul (Greek = psyche, or the unconscious in depth psychology terms).
Carl Jung, the great Swiss psychiatrist, made a career of studying the archetypal images that bubbled up from the soul (unconscious) that could be found in common in all cultures. Many of these images are ensconced in legends, myths and fairy tales. And many of these legends appear in similar fashion in cultures around the world. Creation stories are a good example of this.
The historical view of how the Americas were populated show roaming tribes crossing the Bering Strait from Asia or coming in boats across the Pacific Ocean from Polynesia. Yet the indigenous cultures in Latin America have their own creation stories which have many parallels to the Genesis account. God created them in their own land, they did not migrate from some other place. Is that any less believable than our view that somehow God created humankind in Mesopotamia? I won’t argue whether our view of creation is historical or not. The fact that similar stories about creation arise around the world is what fascinates me.
My view is that these creation stories, as well as many others that cultures around the world hold in common, come from the indelible stamp of the “image of God” on our souls. Whether you call it the collective unconscious as Jung did, or the soul as I did, these archetypal images and tales give humankind a longing for a relationship with our creator, and a restlessness until we find the meaning for our existence in our God-likeness.
We see the combination of history and legend in many of our Christian celebrations. Christmas, for example, was placed during the time of pagan celebrations of the winter solstice when the ancients feared that darkness would encompass the whole world rendering it lifeless. The festival of lights ceremonies to placate the gods into bringing back the sun is why we have candles and lights at Christmas. The ancients in the Americas had similar ceremonies during the winter solstice.
The historically minded would call this syncretism. I would call this proof of a longing for God that is stamped into the soul of every human being on the face of the earth, and a preparation of the soul for the arrival of Christ.
History or legend? It doesn’t need to be either or. In my view, it is both history and legend. The two do not have to compete with each other. With the one we see with the eyes of our minds, with the other we see with the eyes of our souls. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Explain how the concept of the collective unconscious, as proposed by Carl Jung, can be used to understand the shared archetypal images and creation stories across cultures, drawing on examples from both indigenous Latin American civilizations and Christian traditions.

Analyze the creation stories of at least two cultures and identify common archetypal images or themes.
Discuss how these shared images reflect a universal longing for a relationship with a creator or higher power.
Evaluate the relationship between history and legend in these stories, considering the idea that they are not mutually exclusive.


### ANSWER:
The collective unconscious proposed by Carl Jung explains how shared archetypal images and creation stories across cultures are possible.","### FEEDBACK:  The response provides a good starting point for understanding the concept of the collective unconscious, but lacks depth and supporting evidence.

To strengthen the argument, consider providing specific examples of creation stories from indigenous Latin American civilizations, such as the Aztecs or Incas, and compare them to Christian creation stories, highlighting common archetypal images or themes.
To further develop the discussion, explore how these shared images reflect a universal longing for a relationship with a creator or higher power, and consider the implications of this concept for our understanding of human culture and spirituality.
To address the final task, evaluate the relationship between history and legend in these stories, considering the idea that they are not mutually exclusive, and discuss how this concept challenges or reinforces our understanding of the collective unconscious."

White blood cell levels are a good predictor of strokes, heart attacks, and fatal heart disease in older women, according to a nationwide study. White cell counts can be easily measured by inexpensive, widely available tests, raising the possibility of lowering the toll of heart disease fatalities, the leading cause of death among women in the United States.
""For years, researchers have suspected a link between elevated white blood cell count and heart attack,"" notes JoAnn Manson, one of the study leaders and Elizabeth F. Brigham Professor of Women's Health at Harvard Medical School. ""The present study is the largest to test this association and provides the strongest evidence to date that WBC (white blood cell) count predicts the risk of heart attack.""
As part of the federally supported Women's Health Initiative, investigators at medical centers all over the United States collected information on 72,242 postmenopausal women 50 to 79 years old. All were free of heart and blood vessel disease at the start of the study. During six years of follow-up, 1,626 heart disease deaths, heart attacks, and strokes occurred. Women with more than 6.7 billion white cells per liter of blood had more than double the risk of fatal heart disease than women with 4.7 billion cells per liter or lower. A count of 6.7 is considered to be in the upper range of normal, so what is ""normal"" may have to be redefined.
Women with the highest counts had a 40 percent higher risk of nonfatal heart attack, 46 percent higher risk of stroke, and a 50 percent greater risk of death from all causes.
These research results are independent of other risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, and lack of physical activity. Therefore, WBC count may identify people with a high probability of heart disease who show none of the more obvious risk factors.
Relevance for men
Asked if the same test would be as revealing for men, Manson answered, ""We have every reason to believe so. Some small studies have suggested a similar link in men. There probably will be other studies to look at this link in greater depth.""
Manson also believes that white blood cell counts apply to younger as well as older women. ""They would apply, but women under 50 are less likely to have high counts,"" she says. ""That's because they are less likely to have been exposed to risk factors that raise the counts and eventually lead to hardening and blockage of their arteries.""
Women (or men) can take steps to keep their counts down, simply by reducing or avoiding things that tend to raise them, such as smoking, high cholesterol levels, and being overweight, Manson says. ""We are also looking into the contribution of factors like high blood pressure and diabetes,"" she points out. ""Although all these risk factors correlate with high WBC counts, the two are independent so WBC levels can be elevated in the absence of traditional factors.""
No new tests need to be developed, because blood-cell levels are now measured routinely in doctors' offices. The tests identify patients with infections or check for those at risk for infections, like cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. ""Physicians may want to look closer at WBC levels when obtaining the tests for other reasons,"" Manson notes. ""However, infections can cause a high white blood cell count that may make it appear that a patient is at high risk for heart disease when she is not. Therefore, routinely giving everyone the test to screen for heart disease is premature. More research needs to be done.""
A companion test
High WBC levels signal the presence of inflammation in blood vessels, which doctors believe is involved in hardening and clogging arteries. Someday, this test might be combined with measurement of C-reactive protein, another marker for inflammation. The Women's Health Initiative study included measurements of CRP, and it turned out to be almost as good a predictor of heart disease.
""Used together, the two can provide additive and powerful information about risk,"" Manson comments. Women who showed high levels of both inflammation markers had seven times the risk of heart disease as those with low levels.
These results were published in the March 14 issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine. Besides Manson, the authors include Karen Margolis of the Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis and colleagues at participating medical facilities in several other states.
Manson, who is also chief of the division of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, sums up their findings. ""WBC count appears to be a very promising way to identify people at increased risk of heart disease. At this point, it may add information that physicians can use when evaluating a patient's risk factors. With additional research, it may become one of the routine screening tests for heart disease.""

Brief from the NBR Analysis Series
Northeast Asia Turns Its Attention to the Arctic
Linda Jakobson, Director of the East Asia Program at the Lowy Institute for International Policy, argues that the United States can both protect its interests in the Arctic and support permanent observer status for China, Japan, and South Korea. By backing their applications, Washington would give up little in the way of direct influence on Arctic matters, while benefiting from discussions with these countries to better understand their positions and intentions.
China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ROK) have each applied to become a permanent observer on the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental forum established in 1996. Until the 21st century, the Arctic Council was mainly concerned with coordinating the protection of the environment and the rights of indigenous peoples. However, the council’s political significance has risen in tandem with the increasing pace of the melting of Arctic ice, and today it is regarded as the most influential international institution for developing Arctic governance and cooperation.
All three countries have lobbied energetically for approval of their applications at the next ministerial meeting in May 2013. Yet, the inclusion of new permanent observers remains a contentious issue among the eight permanent members, which include the five Arctic littoral states (Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the United States) and the remaining Arctic circumpolar states (Finland, Iceland, and Sweden). At the two previous meetings in 2009 and 2011, ministers chose to defer a decision on new observers. Although in 2012 all the Nordic countries have expressed support for granting China, Japan, and the ROK permanent observer status, Canada, Russia, and the United States remain silent on the issue. The United States—along with Canada and Russia—would benefit from the inclusion of these countries as permanent observers and should back their applications at the next Arctic Council meeting.
Growing Asian Interest in the Arctic
China’s, Japan’s, and the ROK’s recent interest in the Arctic region is driven primarily by economic motives. In the coming decades, melting ice is expected to affect food production in Northeast Asia, while at the same time offering new opportunities for many shipping-related industries, fishing, and resource exploration. In addition, China views its participation in Arctic governance issues as a given based on its status as a rising global power. The ROK, in turn, views involvement in the Arctic as a means to boost its image as an emerging global player.
Over the past five years, these Northeast Asian states have taken the following steps to protect what they perceive as their key interests in the Arctic:
- Deepening their knowledge of climate change in order to be able to respond effectively to its effects on food production and extreme weather patterns
- Securing access, at reasonable cost, to Arctic shipping routes when conditions permit regular commercial shipping in the summer
- Strengthening their ability as non-Arctic states to access the region’s resources and fishing waters
In pursuing these goals, China, Japan, and the ROK draw on strong polar scientific capabilities, which they have acquired over the past decades during their scientific polar research activities, primarily in the Antarctic. The Arctic remains a secondary focus for all three states, though the Arctic too has received increased funding in the past few years. China and the ROK conduct regular Arctic explorations on their own scientific icebreaker. China is building a second icebreaker, with Finnish expertise.
China’s Interest Evokes Concern
China’s Arctic aspirations, in particular, have evoked the same kind of concern, even anxiety, that throughout history has accompanied the rise of a large power. No one knows with certainty how China will use its power. The aggressive posture of China’s representative at the Arctic Council’s observers meeting in Stockholm in November 2012 only aggravated these concerns. Although Chinese officials have been cautious in their statements about the country’s interests in the Arctic—especially in regard to resources—and have committed to respecting the sovereign rights of the Arctic states, they have also emphasized the need for Arctic states to respect the interests and rights of non-Arctic states.
According to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which the United States has not ratified, all states have the right to exploit resources in international waters. However, China is worried that the area deemed to be international waters in the Arctic will shrink considerably if all the existing and anticipated claims by Arctic states on outer continental shelf extensions are deemed legal. Moreover, Beijing stresses that Arctic matters are global, not regional, because the changes taking place, particularly the melting of the polar ice cap, have a global impact. Chinese researchers now call China a “near-Arctic state” and an “Arctic stakeholder,” underscoring its view that it should participate in discussions and decisions pertaining to the future of the Arctic.
Permanent observer status would, at least in the short to medium term, not empower China, Japan, or the ROK in the Arctic Council because observers do not have the right to vote. But as permanent observers they would automatically be invited to Arctic Council activities and meetings, whereas they now have to await an invitation as ad hoc observers. In China’s case, one can surmise that Beijing wants to ensure a seat, even if only in the back row, partly because of concerns that at some point in the future it may not be a desired attendee and partly because of the hope—shared by both the ROK and Japan—that observers could over time attain more influence.
The United States can both protect its interests in the Arctic and support permanent observer status for China, Japan, and the ROK. By backing their applications, Washington would give up little in the way of direct influence on Arctic matters, while benefiting from substantial discussions with these countries to better understand their positions and intentions. Although China and the United States began to hold an annual dialogue on the law of the sea and polar issues in 2010, as a part of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, the Arctic remains a marginal issue in these discussions. Furthermore, engaging the three Northeast Asian states more deeply in Arctic Council activities will encourage them to pay serious attention to legitimate environmental concerns pertaining to shipping and resource exploration in the fragile Arctic environment.

Design a postcard for the Arctic Council from the perspective of a representative of one of the Northeast Asian states (China, Japan, or South Korea) seeking permanent observer status. The postcard should illustrate the state's key interests in the Arctic region and its stance on environmental concerns.

Include an eye-catching image representing your chosen state's connection to the Arctic, such as a scientific icebreaker or a map of the Arctic shipping routes.
In a short message on the postcard, outline the key interests and environmental concerns of your chosen state, using specific examples from the provided text.
Emphasize your state's commitment to sustainable development and cooperation in the Arctic region.


### ANSWER:
A postcard design featuring an image of a Chinese scientific icebreaker navigating through Arctic waters, with an icy mountain range in the background.","### FEEDBACK:  A good start on the postcard design, but there are a few areas that need improvement.

The image description should be more specific, such as 'A Chinese scientific icebreaker, the Xuelong, navigating through Arctic waters, with an icy mountain range in the background.' This provides more context and clarity.
The message on the postcard should be more detailed and specific, such as 'As a permanent observer, China is committed to sustainable development and cooperation in the Arctic region. Our key interests include securing access to Arctic shipping routes and resource exploration, while respecting the environmental concerns of Arctic states. We believe that cooperation and dialogue are key to addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by climate change in the Arctic.' This provides more insight into China's stance and interests.
The postcard should also include a clear call to action, such as 'Join us in the Arctic Council to discuss and address the challenges and opportunities presented by climate change in the Arctic.' This encourages engagement and cooperation."
