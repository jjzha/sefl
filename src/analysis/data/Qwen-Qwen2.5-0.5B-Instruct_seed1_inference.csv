We all know, the muscle mass diminish as we age, which leads to progressive loss in our muscle strength. But many of us might not know that the power dwindles even more rapidly. Whereas strength is an important factor, but your capacity to produce power is more critical to your ability to carry on the activities of everyday living.
Read on to learn what Power Training is? How to do Power-Training with examples, tips & VIDEOS, especially for beginners, older adults & seniors.
To understand the difference between strength & power, just consider this everyday-living example: A senior citizen who has sufficient strength can in all likely hood cross an extremely busy intersection with relative ease. In comparison, a senior citizen who is able to produce more power can cross the same intersection faster before the light changes.
Effect Of Power & Strength Training On Every Day Physical Functions
A study published in the Journal of Gerontology, Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences in 2003 analyzed the effects of a sixteen-week exercise program on the physical activities. In this study 39 subjects between the ages of 65 & 90 participated. They were randomly divided in three groups.
(ii) Control Group: Participants were asked to continue their usual activity with no intervention.
(ii) Second Group: Participants were performed a sixteen-week strength-training routine of traditional resistance exercises 3 days per week.
(iii) Third group performed were instructed to perform eight weeks of traditional strength training followed by 8 weeks of power training.
It was found at the end of the sixteen weeks, the power-training group exhibited greater improvements in physical function. (Source).
Power Training For Senior Citizens & Older Adults
Most people, including senior citizens & older adults, can benefit from power training. You can include power-training exercises into your workout routine, provided you are already doing exercises and have a good foundation of strength. Moreover, if you have joint pain, instability or joint inflammation then you should not do power training.
You can do power training in various ways, but performing the usual resistance exercises is a great way to begin. Here are some good tips to start including power training into senior fitness workout programs:
(i) Choose both upper- and lower-body types of exercises that you are already performing well.
(ii) Practice to perform the exercise quickly during the concentric phase & slowly, in a controlled manner during the eccentric phase.
(iii) Select multi-joint exercises that mimic activities of daily living.
Examples Of Power Exercises
Upper Body: Pushups
Move into the downward phase slowly in a controlled manner (e.g., for 3 counts). Next, do the upward phase rapidly (e.g., 1 count). Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
Note: The beginners & seniors can watch this video to learn proper technique of doing pushups. Note: For power do the upward movement quickly & downward movement slowly.
Lower Body: Body-weight Squat
Move into the downward phase slowly in a controlled manner (e.g., for 3 counts). Next, stand up rapidly (e.g., 1 count). Perform the desired number of repetitions.
Note: The beginners & seniors can watch this video to learn proper technique of doing squats. Note: For power do the upward movement quickly & downward movement slowly.
Important: Power Training Tips
(i) Like traditional strength training, power training can be done on 2 to 3 nonconsecutive days in a week. Keep the exercise intensity somewhere between 20-80% of your 1-RM. Do 1 to 3 sets of six to 12 repetitions. Be sure to start conservatively and progressively increase intensity, reps & sets as you gain power & strength.
(ii) Select some strength exercise, which you can do comfortably. Perform it’s concentric & eccentric contractions in the manner as stated in the above two examples to increase your functional power. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Create a short skit illustrating the difference between muscle strength and power in the context of crossing a busy intersection, inspired by the example in the article.

Write a script that showcases one character successfully crossing the intersection with sufficient strength, but struggling to do so quickly, while another character crosses the intersection rapidly, highlighting the importance of power.
Incorporate props or visual elements to differentiate between the two characters' approaches, such as a timer or a 'walk/don't walk' signal.
Ensure the skit is 2-3 minutes long and includes a clear narrative demonstrating the distinction between strength and power in everyday activities.


### ANSWER:
I would create a short skit where two characters, Alex and Ben, are standing at a busy intersection, waiting for the light to change. When the light turns green, Alex, who has sufficient strength, starts crossing the intersection at a moderate pace. However, Ben, who has more power, quickly sprints across the intersection, beating the changing light.","### FEEDBACK: 200 WORDS

"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
It's natural for your children to be eager to open their presents on Christmas, but it might not come as naturally for them to want to give gifts to others. It takes time, energy, and perhaps even their own money to buy or make gifts that will be well received. As a parent, you’re well aware of the joy giving to others brings. Teaching your children how to give meaningful gifts that bring smiles to others will allow them to share in this important aspect of the holiday season.
Gift Giving Values to Teach
Rather than diving right in to take your kids to the store, you should first take the time to lay a foundation of gift giving values. These underlying principles can help children understand why they are going to give gifts and will help them to develop genuine enthusiasm for the activity.
Considering the feelings of others: Start by reminding your children how they feel after they receive a gift they really enjoy. You can guide them to think about a specific gift they received from someone, and then ask how the gift giver probably felt after giving such a special gift. Guide your children to consider who they might want to give gifts to and to think about how those people might feel when they receive the gifts.
Choosing appropriate gifts: Talk to your children about money and how the best gifts are not always the most expensive. Help your children brainstorm a few of the things that the people in their life might enjoy receiving from them. A question your kids can answer is, ""What could I give this person to show them I care about them?"" This can help your children think of meaningful gifts that will truly bring delight to the recipients.
Ideas of Gifts Children Can Give
You should encourage your children to brainstorm gift ideas, and they might surprise you with their creativity. However, it can help to have some ideas to suggest to get them started or to help them think of new categories of gifts if they get stuck.
- Potted plants or flowers
- Book or movie
- Mug and cocoa packets or tea bags
- Christmas tree ornaments
- Photo in a decorated frame
- Homemade card with a handwritten note
- Cookies or fudge
- Woven or beaded bracelet or necklace
- Votive candle holders
- Painted refrigerator magnets
- Fabric or paper bookmarks
When they are done buying or making gifts, help your children wrap the gifts and write out gift tags or cards to go with them. Being involved in each stage of the process helps them feel more ownership and get more joy out of seeing the recipient open the gift. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Design a Gift-Giving Activity for a Holiday Event

Choose a fictional character who is often overlooked during holiday gift exchanges and decide on a meaningful gift to give this person. What are the character's interests, needs, or values that you considered when selecting the gift?
Explain how involving the gift-giver in each stage of the gift-giving process (idea generation, gift creation or selection, wrapping, and presentation) contributes to the overall value and joy of giving.
Reflect on a time when you gave a gift to someone and describe how thinking about the recipient's feelings influenced your choice of gift. What values or principles guided your decision, and what was the outcome?


### ANSWER:
For task 1, choose a fictional character, such as Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars, who is often overlooked during holiday gift exchanges. A meaningful gift to give Jar Jar could be a customized, eco-friendly fishing pole, taking into account his love for fishing and being outdoors on the planet Naboo. For task 2, involving the gift-giver in each stage of the gift-giving process contributes to the overall value and joy of giving by fostering a sense of ownership, responsibility, and thoughtfulness. For task 3, reflecting on a time when I gave a gift, I remember creating a customized photo album for my grandmother, considering her sentimental nature and love for family. It was heartwarming to see her emotional response, and it reinforced the value of showing appreciation and gratitude through gift-giving.","### FEEDBACK: 5/5

**Task 1: Choosing a meaningful gift**

Your approach to choosing a meaningful gift for Jar Jar Binks is thoughtful and creative. By considering his love for fishing and outdoor activities, you've created a unique and heartfelt present that aligns with his interests. The idea generation phase allowed you to engage with his hobbies and preferences, while the gift creation or selection phase helped tailor the gift to his specific needs and desires. Wrapping and presenting the gift also adds a personal touch, which is crucial for conveying the significance of the gesture. Overall, your selection demonstrates a deep understanding of Jar Jar's personality and interests, resulting in an impactful gift that will resonate with him.

**Task 2: Influencing the gift-giver**

Involving the gift-giver in the gift-giving process has been a valuable tool in shaping their perspective. By asking questions like ""What could I give this person to show them I care about them?"" you encouraged them to reflect on the importance of thoughtful gestures and the impact they would have on Jar Jar’s life. This direct engagement shows empathy and a genuine desire to contribute positively to Jar Jar's life, thereby influencing their decision-making process.

**Task 3: Reflection on a Time When You Gave a Gift**

Reflecting on a time when you gave a gift highlights the importance of thoughtful consideration. Creating a customized photo album for your grandmother demonstrated a commitment to her memory and the memories she shared. This act of reflection on the value of the gift and its lasting impact on her life underscores the significance of thoughtful expressions of gratitude and generosity.

Overall, your choices and reflections demonstrate a strong connection to the gift-giving process and the recipient, which is reflected in both your creative gift ideas and your thoughtful involvement in the gift-giving journey."
"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
Sorry that it’s been forever since I posted. I started this post a couple weeks ago but hit a dead end trying to explain it, set it aside, then got busy with other things. This post was a tough one and I’m still doing my best to wrap my head around it but I thought it was incredibly interesting and trying to explain something is often the best way to understand it yourself. However, I have no background in physics whatsoever and the purpose of this post is to make ideas accessible to everyday people so if I make any egregious technical errors or simplify a concept to much, please feel free to correct me in the comments.
This topic requires a little bit of background. Back in the days of the ancient Greeks, it was believed that the natural state for all things to be in was resting. Something only moved if it was pushed and, left to it’s own devices, it would go back to being still. This was the belief for a long, long time because no one ever really bothered to test if it was true or not.
Eventually, Galileo did an experiment which showed that that was not the case and that when a force acts on an object, it’s effect is to speed it up or slow it down. Not just get it moving in the first place. When you push a ball, it does not stop on it’s own, but rather is stopped by friction on the ground and air resistance. If those and other external forces didn’t exist, it would continue to move forever. Newton expanded on that idea by publishing his laws of motion and gravity. For simplicity’s sake, I’m not going to recite them in this post but you can look them up here.
Newton’s laws have a lot of implications but the most important one for our purposes is that the idea of an absolute state of rest is incorrect. Common sense would lead us to believe that there is an absolute state of rest. Look at your chair or computer. It’s not moving and thus appears to be at rest. But while it looks like it’s just sitting there, it’s actually hurdling 67,000 mph (along with the rest of the planet) around the sun. And the sun is moving at it’s own breakneck speed around the center of the galaxy. So if you walk down the street at a brisk pace, are you walking at 5 mph or at 67,005 mph? Either one is technically correct and it demonstrates that the idea of space is relative, not absolute. Another example (shamelessly stolen from the book where I am getting most of my information, A Brief History of Time by Steven Hawking) is that of a train travelling north at 60 mph. Since the universe has no definitive boundaries, it would be equally correct to say that the earth is standing still and the train is moving north at 60 mph or that the train is standing still and the earth is moving down at 60 mph. Or both.
This was a major milestone in understanding the universe, however people still thought of time as being absolute and unrelated to a “relative space”. Time marched forward, one second at a time and there was nothing anyone could do about it. However, people were still scratching their heads about something else: light. Did light have a constant speed? Well, in 1865, James Clerk Maxwell predicted that it did. So how fast does it go? The way that you determine speed is by dividing the distance it travels by the time it takes to get there. But space is not absolute, so no one could agree on how far it had traveled, even if they could agree on how long it took to get there.
In 1905, Albert Einstein, in a paper in response to this quandry, proposed his famous equation, E = mc^2. This essentially said that as an object goes faster, it gets heavier and thus requires more energy to propel it forward. Eventually, it will get to a point where it is infinitely heavy and requires an infinite amount of energy to move it and can not move any faster. However, since light has no mass, it can go faster then that speed (at 299,792,458 m/s to be exact) and nothing can move faster than light. This equation gave light a constant speed that was not affected by distance. To find the time it takes to get from one place to another, you divide the speed by the distance traveled. If no one can agree on the distance, since space is relative, it follows that no one can agree on the time it took to get there. This leads us to the conclusion that time is ALSO relative to the observer and is not a constant force which had been believed for thousands of years. This also integrated space and time so much that they can no longer be seen as separate and are now referred to as space-time.
I hope that that was a simple enough explanation. It’s hard to simplify it too much and still hit all the main points. Feel free to leave comments and let me know what you thought! Also, if you have any topics that you thought sounded interesting but were just too lazy to look up, let me know and I will try to get them explained for you!

Imagine you are on a train moving at 50 miles per hour in a straight line. At the same time, the train is also moving with the Earth as it rotates on its axis and revolves around the Sun. Write a short paragraph (less than 150 words) explaining the different perspectives on your speed and how they relate to the concept of relative space and relative time.

Use examples and analogies to make your explanation clear and concise, and be sure to address how your speed would be perceived differently by observers on the train, on the Earth, and in another galaxy.


### ANSWER:
As I sit on this train moving at 50 miles per hour, I can perceive my speed in different ways depending on my frame of reference. From my perspective on the train, I am at rest, but an observer on the platform watching me pass by would say I'm moving at 50 miles per hour. This is an example of relative space - my speed is not absolute, but depends on the observer's frame of reference. Now, consider the Earth rotating on its axis and revolving around the Sun. An observer on Earth would say I'm moving at a combination of the train's speed and the Earth's speed. But an observer in another galaxy would see me moving at a much faster speed, combining the train, Earth, and galaxy's speeds. This highlights how our perception of speed and time is relative, not absolute.","### FEEDBACK: 200 WORDS OR LESS

**Student:** ""Thank you for explaining the differences between my speed and the Earth's speed, it made a lot more sense now. It's amazing how our perceptions of space and time can vary based on our frames of reference.""

The Spanish American War
The Spanish-American War
You take the Spanish-American War. . . . That was Mr. Kane’s war. We didn’t really have anything to fight about. But do you think if it hadn’t been for that war of Mr. Kane’s we’d have the Panama Canal?
In 1941, a muckraking biography of William Randolph Hearst opened on American movie screens. Titled Citizen Kane, this splendid film gives news- paper editor and owner Charles Foster Kane (a thinly disguised stand-in for Hearst) credit for having deliberately provoked the Spanish-American War with the inflammatory headlines in his newspapers. This was no exaggeration on the part of the filmmakers.
Born in 1863 to millionaire parents, Hearst owned major newspapers across the United States. Hearst thought like a businessman rather than like a journalist; his goal was to sell as many papers as possible, not necessarily to give the public accurate information. He had no objection to exaggerating or inventing facts in order to create sensational stories. This “yellow journalism” became the New York Journal’s trademark. With what one historian later referred to as the “acme of ruthless, truthless newspaper jingoism,” Hearst used the Journal to push the United States into a war with Spain.
In 1896, Cuba was trying to win its independence from Spain. Knowing that the dramatic events of the rebellion would interest his readers, Hearst encouraged his reporters to exaggerate the facts and stir up American resentment against Spain. Many Americans sympathized with the Cuban revolutionaries, who were fighting a tyrant just as the Americans themselves had once fought Great Britain. Journal stories deliberately played on this sympathy, actively pressuring the U.S. government to declare war on Spain. President McKinley resisted the pressure.
The spark that set off the war was the sudden explosion of the American battleship Maine, anchored off the Cuban coast in case its crew should be needed to protect American property or lives. What caused the ship to blow up is still unknown; independent investigations at the time suggested that it might have been either accident or an underwater mine. Few people seriously believed that it was an act of war on Spain’s part, since Spanish diplomats had been working hard to avoid an all-out war with the United States. Ignoring the facts, Hearst put the story of the Maine on the front page for several days, with headlines such as:
- THE WARSHIP MAINE WAS SPLIT IN TWO BY AN ENEMY’S SECRET INFERNAL MACHINE.
- THE WHOLE COUNTRY THRILLS WITH THE WAR FEVER
- HOW THE MAINE ACTUALLY LOOKS AS IT LIES, WRECKED BY SPANISH TREACHERY, IN HAVANA BAY
With the people clamoring for action, McKinley felt that he had no choice but to reject Spain’s request for a peace agreement. On April 25, 1898, Congress declared war. It would be fought on three fronts: in Cuba, in Puerto Rico, and in the Philippines, which served at the time as a Spanish naval base.
Commodore George Dewey led a fleet of American warships from the coast of Hong Kong to the Philippines a few days after Congress declared war. The American ships easily overpowered the Spanish fleet guarding the Manila harbor. The Filipinos had been rebelling against Spanish rule for two years and were easily enlisted to help the Americans conquer Manila. The war in the Philippines ended in August 1898.
Unlike the navy, which had covered itself with glory in the Philippines, the army was not adequately prepared for a land war in Cuba. The United States did not maintain a large standing army in peacetime, and the only uniforms the soldiers were supplied with were made of heavy wool—highly unsuitable for the tropical climate of Cuba.
Theodore Roosevelt had joined the army, which placed him in command of a cavalry unit nicknamed the Rough Riders, whose goal was to capture the high ground above the city of Santiago. The Rough Riders charged up San Juan Hill under a hail of Spanish bullets, and had control of the high ground by night- fall. The U.S. Navy sank the entire Spanish fleet off the coast of Cuba, and the war ended two weeks later when Spain surrendered. Fighting in Puerto Rico had already ended. The United States agreed to pay Spain $20 million for the Philippines, Cuba gained its independence from Spain, and Spain ceded Guam to the United States.

Consider the role of yellow journalism in the lead-up to the Spanish-American War. Provide a comparative analysis of Hearst's journalistic practices and their impact on public opinion in the United States.

Describe the key characteristics of yellow journalism, using specific examples from the text to illustrate Hearst's approach to reporting on the Cuban rebellion and the sinking of the USS Maine.
Analyze the ways in which Hearst's portrayal of events influenced American public opinion, drawing on evidence from the text to support your argument.
Evaluate the ethical implications of Hearst's journalistic practices and their potential consequences for a democratic society.


### ANSWER:
Yellow journalism, as exemplified by Hearst, relies on sensationalism, exaggeration, and distortion of facts to attract readers and shape public opinion. In the lead-up to the Spanish-American War, Hearst's New York Journal employed this approach to report on the Cuban rebellion and the sinking of the USS Maine, using headlines such as 'THE WARSHIP MAINE WAS SPLIT IN TWO BY AN ENEMY'S SECRET INFERNAL MACHINE' to create a sense of outrage and urgency. These tactics successfully whipped up public sentiment against Spain, contributing to the pressure on President McKinley to declare war. However, the ethical implications of such practices are that they undermine the principles of objective journalism and can lead to the manipulation of public opinion, potentially resulting in ill-informed decision-making. Moreover, Hearst's actions during this period demonstrate the dangers of unchecked media power and the importance of a free press in holding those in power accountable for their actions.","### FEEDBACK: 200 WORDS OR LESS

---

**Example Response:**

**Introduction:**
The Spanish-American War, spanning from 1898 to 1899, marked a pivotal moment in American history where the country entered into a conflict with Spain over territorial disputes and economic interests. The war resulted in the loss of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines to the United States. Prior to the war, newspapers such as the New York Journal and the New York Times had become prominent players in the dissemination of false narratives and sensationalist reporting, feeding public alarm and anxiety. These newspapers capitalized on the chaos created by the Mexican–American War, portraying the Spanish as barbaric invaders and the United States as benevolent benefactors. By highlighting the atrocities committed by the Spanish forces, the newspapers aimed to generate excitement and mobilize public support for the impending conflict.

**Role of Yellow Journalism:**
Yellow journalism, characterized by sensationalism, exaggerated details, and misleading reporting, was a key aspect of the propaganda campaign waged by newspapers like the New York Journal. The New York Journal, known for its bold headline writing, used phrases like ""The Warship Maine Was Split in Two,"" ""How the Maine Actively Looks, Wrecked by Spanish Treacherous Machine,"" and ""The Whole Country Thrills with the War Fever"" to incite fear and panic among the American public. These headlines effectively spread misinformation and fueled public dissatisfaction, driving Congress to declare war on Spain.

**Impact on Public Opinion:**
The success of yellow journalism during the war significantly contributed to the pressure on President McKinley to declare war. The newspapers provided a platform for the American public to voice their grievances and share their fears, leading to widespread discontent. The perceived betrayal of the Spanish Empire and the subsequent declaration of war on Spain, coupled with the loss of territory, galvanized public opinion against Spain. Newspapers like the New York Journal and the New York Times were instrumental in amplifying the narrative of national peril and urging Americans to join the war effort.

**Ethical Implications:**
While yellow journalism undoubtedly facilitated public unrest, it also raised serious ethical concerns. The practice of sensationalism could lead to the distortion of historical facts and the suppression of legitimate information. Furthermore, the manipulation of public opinion through false narratives could contribute to political polarization and undermine democratic institutions. As the war progressed, newspapers continued to play a crucial role in shaping public opinion, often aligning with the prevailing political ideology and serving as a conduit for ideological messaging.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, yellow journalism, particularly that of the New York Journal, played a crucial role in shaping public opinion during the lead-up to the Spanish-American War. Through the use of sensationalist headlines, the newspapers propagated anti-Spanish sentiments and instilled fear in the American populace. While these methods may have initially succeeded in rallying public support, they ultimately contributed to the escalation of tensions between the United States and Spain. Today, the lessons learned from the Spanish-American War underscore the importance of maintaining objectivity and impartiality in journalism to prevent similar misrepresentations and promote informed citizenship."

#### Introduction

The `BookGuide` class is designed to manage a simple book organization system, allowing users to add books to specific categories and view various functionalities such as viewing all books, viewing a single category, listing all categories, adding a new book, and exiting the program.

#### Methods

1. **add_book(self, title, category)**:
   - This method allows adding a book to a specified category. If the category does not exist yet, it creates an empty list.
   - The book title is added to the appropriate category list.

2. **view_category(self, category)**:
   - This method lists all books belonging to a given category.
   - It returns a list containing the titles of all books in that category.

3. **list_categories(self)**:
   - This method displays all categories in the library.

4. **view_all(self)**:
   - This method lists all books currently stored in the library.

#### Menu System

The main menu includes options for adding a book, viewing a specific category, listing all categories, adding a new book, and exiting the application.

#### Example Usage

Let’s create an instance of the `BookGuide` class and start exploring its features.

```python
# Initialize the BookGuide object
book_guide = BookGuide()

# Adding a book
title = ""Introduction to Python""
category = ""Introductory""
book_guide.add_book(title, category)

# Viewing all books in a category
print(book_guide.view_category(""Introductory""))

# Listing all categories
print(book_guide.list_categories())

# Adding a new book
new_title = ""Python Programming Basics""
book_guide.add_book(new_title, ""Advanced"")

# Exiting the program
print(""\nExiting..."")
```

This code initializes a `BookGuide` object, adds two books with titles and categories, views all books in the Introductory category, lists all categories, adds a new book, and then exits the program gracefully."

Every December for the past nineteen years, marchers in Bhopal, India, have paraded an effigy of Warren Anderson through town and burned it. Anderson is despised because he was the CEO of Union Carbide on December 3, 1984, when an explosion at the company's Bhopal factory leaked deadly methyl isocyanate gas over the city's shantytowns in the worst industrial disaster in history. The exact death toll will never be known -- many corpses were disposed of in emergency mass burials or cremations without adequate documentation -- but the Indian government now puts the total at more than 22,000 and climbing.
As the disaster's twentieth anniversary approaches, Bhopal is back in the news. On April 19 two advocates for the survivors won the most prestigious environmental award given in the United States. In her acceptance speech at the annual Goldman Environmental Prize ceremony in San Francisco, Rashida Bee confessed that she and colleague Champa Devi Shukla initially assumed they had been selected by mistake. ""We knew a few individuals who had won awards,"" she explained, ""[but] they were all educated people, spoke English and had e-mail accounts.""
One a Muslim and the other a Hindu, Bee and Shukla are leading the fight to hold Union Carbide and its new owner, Dow Chemical, accountable for the Bhopal disaster, which the two women assert is still killing and injuring thousands of people a year through poisoned groundwater. ""The gas disaster was sudden, one night, but the last twenty years have also been miserable,"" Shukla said in an interview. ""People still have pain and breathlessness, and now we are seeing cancers, too. There is mental and physical retardation among children. Many women are sterile or never begin menstruating, so men don't want to marry them."" A 1999 study commissioned by Greenpeace International but conducted by independent scientists concluded that Bhopal's groundwater contains heavy metals, volatile chemicals and levels of mercury millions of times higher than is considered safe.
Neither Union Carbide nor Dow has ever faced trial for Bhopal -- inconceivable, activists charge, had the disaster occurred in the United States or Europe. Union Carbide instead reached a $470 million settlement with the Indian government in 1989, based on now-discredited estimates that only 3,000 people died and only 100,000 were ""affected."" Upon review of the settlement, an Indian court reinstated criminal charges against Union Carbide and Warren Anderson in 1991. When neither the corporation nor Anderson showed up for trial, they were declared fugitives from justice. The Indian government is now seeking their extradition, but Washington has not honored the request. Meanwhile, Dow, which purchased all outstanding shares of Union Carbide in 1999, refuses to accept the company's alleged Bhopal liabilities. ""Dow remains firm in its position that in acquiring the shares of Union Carbide it acquired no new liability,"" John Musser, a Dow spokesman, wrote in an e-mail interview.
So Bee and Shukla are touring the United States, using the prestige of the Goldman prize to press their case. On May 13 they'll confront Dow officials at a shareholders meeting in Midland, Michigan. They demand that Union Carbide/Dow appear at trial in India, pay for survivors' healthcare and economic rehabilitation and help restore Bhopal's environment. They reject the suggestion that the $470 million settlement discharged the company's obligations. ""Union Carbide made that settlement with the government, not with the people affected,"" says Rashida Bee. ""Not a single victim was consulted.""
Battling the world's biggest chemical corporation is a far cry from the humble beginnings of the two activists. Bee was illiterate and knew nothing of the outside world when, at age 28, she experienced the disaster. It killed seven members of her extended family and left her husband too ill to continue his work as a tailor. Shukla lost her husband and two sons. A daughter later suffered three miscarriages, a grandson died and a granddaughter was born with a cleft lip and a missing palate.
Bee and Shukla consistently refer to what happened in Bhopal as a crime rather than an accident. ""It was Warren Anderson's criminal negligence and insistence on cost-cutting that caused this disaster,"" says Bee. Internal Union Carbide documents, released in 2002 during the discovery phase of a civil lawsuit against the company, seem to support her contention. A 1973 document, signed by Anderson himself, notes that the technology to be used in the Bhopal factory was ""unproven."" A safety review conducted by Union Carbide experts in 1982 warned of a ""serious potential for sizable releases of toxic materials"" at the factory.
Dow spokesman John Musser confirmed the existence of the 1982 study but asserted, ""None of the issues [it] raised would have had an impact on the fatal gas leak and all of the issues had been addressed by the plant well before the December 1984 disaster."" The real culprit, the company insists, was sabotage. Musser further notes that it was the Indian government that declared itself the sole representative of Bhopal's victims before the 1989 settlement. Nor are allegations of groundwater contamination true, he said, citing studies in the late 1990s by local and federal government agencies in India.
""They have their studies, we have ours, so let's go to court and let a judge decide who's right,"" said Gary Cohen, director of the Environmental Health Fund in Boston. Cohen has little hope that the Bush Administration will extradite Anderson or current Union Carbide/Dow officials. But, he says, ""Dow wants to expand in India, and we're going to make that very difficult"" by raising questions about the trustworthiness of a corporation that refuses to heed a court summons. Nityanand Jayaraman of the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal says activists plan to press the Indian government to include Dow, not just Union Carbide, in the current criminal case; the government could then attach Dow's assets if it refuses to appear in court.
For their part, Rashida Bee and Champa Devi Shukla hope to pursue justice face-to-face by tracking down Warren Anderson during their US tour. Shukla says that ""if we see him, we will ask, ""If you are innocent, why are you hiding and not answering questions about what happened in Bhopal?"" \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Consider the Bhopal disaster as a case study. What are the key social, environmental, and economic impacts of the disaster that still persist today, and how do they relate to each other?

The key social, environmental, and economic impacts of the Bhopal disaster that still persist today are closely interconnected. The disaster had an immediate impact on human health, with thousands of people killed or injured, and long-term effects including cancers, mental and physical retardation, and sterility. These health effects have had significant social consequences, including the stigmatization of survivors and their families, and economic consequences, such as the loss of livelihoods and inadequate compensation. The environmental degradation caused by the disaster, including the contamination of groundwater, has had ongoing effects on the ecosystem and human health, perpetuating a cycle of poverty and illness. The lack of adequate compensation and rehabilitation has further exacerbated these impacts, highlighting the need for corporate accountability and sustainable development practices.","### FEEDBACK: 200 WORDS

#### **Title:** Assessing the Long-Term Social, Environmental, and Economic Impacts of the Bhopal Disaster

**Assignment:**  
In your opinion, can you identify any emerging trends or challenges related to the Bhopal disaster that may affect its future trajectory? Provide specific examples to illustrate your assessment.

---

#### **Response:**

**Short-Term Health Effects:**
- **Survivors and Their Descendants:** Survivors often experience chronic illnesses such as cancer, respiratory problems, and neurological disorders. The long-term psychological impacts, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), continue to affect survivors and their families.
- **Public Awareness and Education:** The disaster sparked widespread public awareness about the risks associated with industrial accidents, contributing to increased scrutiny and regulation of hazardous industries. However, some survivors continue to face discrimination and stigma due to the traumatic experiences.

**Long-Term Health Effects:**
- **Economic Impact:** The Bhopal disaster led to substantial financial losses for the state of Haryana, India. This has resulted in reduced investment in infrastructure, education, and healthcare services. Additionally, the long-term health costs for survivors and their families, estimated at $5 billion, represent a significant burden on the national economy.
- **Social Stigma:** Survivors and their families face societal ostracism, limited access to healthcare, and difficulty securing employment. This contributes to a generational gap where younger generations struggle to understand and address the legacy of the disaster.

**Environmental Degradation:**
- **Contamination of Groundwater:** The Bhopal incident exposed the vulnerability of India’s water supply to industrial pollutants. Although improvements in wastewater treatment have reduced contamination, the contamination of groundwater continues to pose a threat to drinking water supplies across the country.
- **Climate Change:** The disaster highlighted the urgent need for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. Addressing the root causes of air pollution and increasing afforestation efforts could mitigate these impacts.
- **Wildlife Habitat Loss:** The destruction of natural habitats due to the pollution and land use changes created by the disaster has led to habitat fragmentation and extinction of wildlife species, affecting biodiversity and ecological balance.

**Economic Consequences:**
- **Job Losses:** The economic fallout from the disaster included job losses in sectors like manufacturing, agriculture, and transportation. The long-term unemployment rates remain high, exacerbating poverty and inequality.
- **Infrastructure Damage:** The collapse of the Bhopal factory and surrounding infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and power plants, resulted in extensive damage to the region's infrastructure. This disruption has hindered economic recovery and development.

**Environmental Degradation:**
- **Air Pollution:** The burning of fossil fuels for electricity generation contributed significantly to the pollution in the Bhopal area. While efforts have been made to reduce emissions, the problem persists, posing a major challenge to air quality.
- **Water Pollution:** Contaminants from the factory site and nearby areas continued to seep into the groundwater, threatening the survival of aquatic life and agricultural crops. Remediation efforts have yet to fully address this issue.

**Environmental Degradation:**
- **Land Use Changes:** The destruction of forests and agricultural lands near the Bhopal factory led to soil erosion and loss of fertile soil, impacting agricultural productivity. This has contributed to rising food prices and malnutrition.
- **Waste Management Issues:** The factory generated large amounts of waste, including hazardous materials, which accumulated in the soil and water bodies. Improper management of this waste poses a risk of environmental contamination and potential health hazards.

**Economic Consequences:**
- **Poverty:** The economic downturn following the disaster led to significant poverty among the survivors and their families. This has resulted in reduced access to basic necessities and improved living standards.
- **Healthcare Costs:** The long-term health impacts of the disaster have led to increased healthcare expenditures, primarily for treating acute conditions resulting from exposure to hazardous substances.
- **Education Outcomes:** The educational failures due to the trauma of the disaster have resulted in reduced academic performance and delayed cognitive development.

**Conclusion:**
The Bhopal disaster has left a lasting impact on society, economy, and the environment. It highlights the need for robust regulatory frameworks, technological advancements, and sustained attention to environmental protection to ensure that the lessons learned from this tragedy are applied effectively to prevent future disasters. The ongoing challenges include addressing the environmental legacy, improving access to clean water and air, and ensuring equitable distribution of resources to combat the socio-economic disparities that persist.

Resistance in the Netherlands
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global problem. Figures provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) show that resistance rates in the Netherlands are low compared to those in other European countries. This is partly because, in the Netherlands, you cannot obtain antimicrobials without a doctor’s prescription. As a result, the use of antimicrobials in the Netherlands is relatively limited. In addition, the healthcare system places great emphasis on effective hygiene measures.
We know that bacteria in all parts of the world are becoming increasingly resistant to antimicrobials. This is why it is important to keep on fighting antimicrobial resistance. Resistant bacteria are found everywhere – in the healthcare system, in animals, in food, in the environment and in every country in the world. This calls for an integrated approach, also known as the ‘One Health’ approach. The Netherlands is taking steps in each of these important areas.
Information about antimicrobial resistance
If we are to protect ourselves against antimicrobial resistance, we need to know how often – and where – resistant bacteria occur, and if there are any trends in this regard. The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVMNational Institute for Public Health and the Environment ) systematically collects and analyses such information. We call this ‘surveillance’. This allows RIVM to track the use of antibiotics and the number of infections involving resistant bacteria in the Netherlands. For example, various laboratories help us by providing information about hospital patients and nursing home residents. Based on this information, we can see how often antimicrobials are being used, which bacteria occur where, whether the number of such cases is increasing or decreasing, and whether new bacteria are appearing. Click here for a summary of our surveillance studies.
RIVM keeps track of the current state of affairs with regard to antimicrobial resistance in the Netherlands and advises the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport of its findings. In this regard, it is important for the parties tackling antimicrobial resistance to keep each other informed. Read more about the role of RIVM.
International collaboration on antimicrobial resistance
Resistant bacteria don’t care about international borders. This is why it is important to cooperate with other countries in fighting antimicrobial resistance. If we can reduce the numbers of resistant bacteria, the entire world will benefit. RIVM cooperates with other countries and shares any information it uncovers when tracking antimicrobial resistance. RIVM also helps others to use this information in specific operations to fight resistance. All international activities focus, to some extent, on work that is being done here in the Netherlands. RIVM focuses specifically on surveillance, AMR in the environment, and One Health. Click here for more information about international cooperation.
You, too, can do something about antibiotic resistance
To keep antibiotics effective for as long as possible, we must use them wisely (i.e. in the correct way, and not too often). If the body needs help to overcome a bacterial infection, doctors prescribe antibiotics. It is important to use them properly, to minimise any risk of resistant bacteria emerging.
- Only use antibiotics when your doctor says that this is necessary. So always contact a doctor first, even if you are abroad.
- Take the prescribed amount at the right time, every day. Do not skip any doses.
- Never stop a course of antibiotic treatment without first checking with a doctor. In some cases it is possible to stop the course of treatment before it is finished, but always check with a doctor first.
- Never use leftover antibiotics or other people’s antibiotics. For each specific infection, a doctor needs to decide whether a course of antibiotic treatment is required, which antibiotic is right for you, and how long the course of treatment should last.
How to prevent the spread of resistant bacteria?
(On-screen title: How to prevent the spread of resistant bacteria. An animation. Voice-over:)
VOICE-OVER: Bacteria can make you ill.
Some bacteria are resistant,
in which case treatment with antibiotics has a limited effect, to none at all.
This can cause you to become very ill, and possibly even die.
(A little figure falls over.)
You can also carry bacteria without becoming immediately ill,
in which case you can still spread them.
The spread of resistant bacteria is dangerous,
especially for people with poor health.
You can be contaminated with a resistant bacterium,
for example, as a result of admission to a nursing home or hospital,
admission to a hospital abroad, or through contact with farm animals.
This is why proper hygiene, such as washing your hands, is important.
If someone is contaminated with a resistant bacterium,
it's important to become aware of this as soon as possible
in order to prevent further spreading.
This is why doctors enquire about possible exposure to resistant bacteria,
whether you have been treated in other nursing homes or hospitals,
in a foreign hospital, or if you have had any contact with farm animals.
Everyone should be attentive to this, so we can minimise the risk.
(On-screen text: National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport. www.rivm.nl/amr.)
Antibiotic resistance: why do some antibiotics fail?
This animation explains what antibiotic resistance is and why some antibiotics fail. Doctors prescribe antibiotics when the body needs help to recover from an infection. Sometimes bacteria have protected themselves against the antibiotic. This infection is more difficult to treat, because the usual antibiotics do not work. If antibiotics are used incorrectly or too often this increases the chances of bacteria becoming resistant. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Create a public service announcement (PSA) script for a 30-second video to inform high school students about the risks of antimicrobial resistance and the importance of proper antibiotic use.

Clearly define antimicrobial resistance and its consequences in 1-2 sentences.
Explain the role of proper antibiotic use and hygiene in preventing the spread of resistant bacteria.
Include at least one statistic or fact from the provided text to support the importance of the issue.
End the script with a call-to-action, encouraging viewers to take responsibility for preventing antimicrobial resistance.


### ANSWER:
PSA title: Antibiotic Resistance: The Silent Threat","### FEEDBACK: 200 WORDS

**Student:** I appreciate the detailed information you've provided about antimicrobial resistance and the importance of proper antibiotic use. However, could you please provide some statistics or examples of how antibiotics contribute to antibiotic resistance? That would help me understand the scale better. Also, could you suggest ways for students to reduce their own reliance on antibiotics, especially in sensitive populations like young children?

**Teacher:** Thank you! Here are the relevant statistics:

- **Number of Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria**: According to the CDC, approximately 7 million people get sick from antibiotic-resistant infections each year. Out of those, around 500,000 of these infections lead to death.
  
- **Impact on Healthcare Systems**: Each year, antibiotics save millions of lives worldwide, but they also contribute to antibiotic resistance, making it harder to treat diseases caused by resistant bacteria.

- **Public Health Impact**: In many regions, antibiotic-resistant bacteria are causing significant problems. In Europe alone, there were over 68,000 deaths linked to drug-resistant infections in 2019.

- **Infections Caused by Antibiotics**: Antibiotics are commonly used to treat infections that may otherwise require surgery or antibiotics prescribed by doctors, leading to unnecessary harm and resource waste.

- **Prevention Strategies**: Proper antibiotic use and adherence are crucial for controlling antibiotic resistance. Regular handwashing, avoiding over-the-counter medications, and seeking medical advice promptly are key preventive measures.

- **Call-to-Action**: By reducing dependence on antibiotics, we can significantly lower the burden on healthcare systems while promoting healthier lifestyles. Join us in protecting our communities from the silent threat of antimicrobial resistance!

Railroad officially arrived at Temuco the very first day of 1893. It is believed that the first locomotive depot was located a few meters to the north of the present one, in lots handed over to the State Railroad Company by mapuche people. Temuco turned into an important railroad center, where long-run trains changed locomotives. That depot also housed the locomotives of the trains covering the branch lines to towns such as Carahue, Cunco and Cherquenco. During the first decades of this century, complex locomotive repair and maintenance works were perfommed in the Temuco locomotive depot. After the San Bernardo Machine Shop started operating in 1920, the Temuco depot kept on doing uncomplicated repairs.
By 1930, the insufficiency of the original depot became ever so evident, so the construction of a new one -that existing at present- was decided. The construction was made in two stages, between 1937 and 1941; at first, the new depot complemented, without replacing, the old one. Until 1954, only steam locomotives were serviced in Temuco; from that year on, diesel machines started being repaired. By 1980, the permanent allocation of the complex consisted in two type 56 steam locomotives, eleven type 57, one type 58, nine type 70, and fourteen type 80.
In 1982, the State Railroad Company's management ordered the constitution of a steam-drive reserve fleet with base in Temuco. On account of this, during the following years, tens of locomotives there housed were repaired. The fireboxes of the last locomotives went out definitively by the end of 1983, fact which, in turn, signaled the end of the locomotive depot's normal operation. The precincts kept on being used for doing minor repairs and for the remarshall of diesel locomotives, type D-16000 and others, and as operational base for tracks maintenance works. The Temuco depot was the steam locomotives operational base that ceased to operate later in the country.
The locomotive depot and the rolling stock it houses are property of the State Railroad Company. It occupies an area of about 19 hectares, one kilometer to the north of the Temuco Railroad Station. It is a railroad complex whose essential component is the round, roofed depot
made of concrete. It has 34 tracks su rrounding a 27 meters long tu rntable . capable of rotating a type 80 locomotive, with tender, weighing over 160 tons. Near to the round depot there are a repair workshop, administrative offices, dressing rooms for the personnel, a large coal elevator for charging fuel into the locomotives' tenders, a coal deposit, and a coach repair shop. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Imagine you are the manager of the Temuco locomotive depot in 1982. Write a letter to the State Railroad Company's management proposing a plan to repurpose the depot after the end of steam locomotives operation, including at least three possible new uses for the facilities and staff.

Consider the existing infrastructure and skilled personnel at the depot.
Think about emerging trends and technologies in transportation and industry.
Address potential benefits and challenges of your proposed plan.


### ANSWER:
Dear State Railroad Company's Management, With the end of steam locomotives operation, I propose repurposing the Temuco locomotive depot into a multi-functional facility supporting the region's transportation and industrial growth. Firstly, the depot's skilled staff can be retrained to maintain and repair diesel locomotives and other rail vehicles, ensuring a seamless transition and preserving local employment. Secondly, we can convert the round depot and repair workshop into a center for the fabrication and refurbishment of rail tracks and supporting infrastructure, leveraging our existing equipment and expertise. This will not only cater to the regional railroad network's maintenance needs but also provide services to private industries requiring specialized steelwork. Thirdly, considering the emergence of tourism in the region, a portion of the depot can be transformed into a steam locomotive museum, showcasing our heritage and offering educational programs. This will create a new revenue stream while preserving our historical significance. Benefits of this plan include preserving employment, adapting to emerging trends, and generating new revenue streams. Challenges will include retraining staff, investing in new equipment, and managing the transition process.","### FEEDBACK: 1
Thank you for the detailed proposal for repurposing the Temuco locomotive depot. However, could you provide more specific information on how you plan to train the existing staff to maintain and repair diesel locomotives? Also, how would you ensure the seamless integration of these new functions into the existing infrastructure?

### FEEDBACK: 2
Your proposal highlights several innovative ideas for repurposing the locomotive depot. Can you elaborate further on how you plan to utilize the converted space for the fabrication and refurbishment of rail tracks and supporting infrastructure? Additionally, what measures will be taken to manage the transition smoothly and ensure that all stakeholders benefit from this transformation?

### FEEDBACK: 3
It would be beneficial if you could provide some data on the current state of the existing railway infrastructure in Temuco and the anticipated demand for rail services in the future. This will help us make informed decisions regarding the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of your plan."

112-year-old Voters in North Carolina?
- November 6, 2012
- Election Initiatives
Early voting began in North Carolina in October, and soon after almost 900 voters aged 112 reportedly cast ballots. In fact in 2008, almost 10,000 108-year olds cast ballots and just over 9,000 110-year olds voted in 2010.
The true explanation is much less exciting.
Prior to passage of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993, the state did not require those registering to provide their birth date. While most voters who registered before NVRA did provide birth dates, some did not. These voters were automatically assigned a default birth date of 01/01/1900 in the state’s voter rolls. So while these voters are still diligently voting, it is very doubtful they are 112 years old. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Analyze the impact of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) on voter registration in North Carolina.

What changes in voter registration did the NVRA bring about in North Carolina in 1993, and how did this explain the reported large numbers of very elderly voters in the state in the years following its passage? Please provide specific dates and facts from the text to support your argument.


### ANSWER:
The NVRA brought about a change in voter registration in North Carolina by requiring registrants to provide their birth date, which was not mandatory prior to its passage in 1993. The lack of birth dates for voters who registered before NVRA resulted in these voters being assigned a default birth date of 01/01/1900, thus explaining the reported large numbers of very elderly voters in the state, such as the almost 900 voters aged 112 who reportedly cast ballots in 2012 and the almost 10,000 108-year olds in 2008.","### FEEDBACK: 200 WORDS OR LESS

**Feedback:**  
Thank you for providing detailed information on the impact of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) on voter registration in North Carolina. Your analysis highlights an important aspect of how the act has influenced voter demographics. By demonstrating that despite the absence of birth dates, many elderly voters remained active in the election process, it underscores the complexity of voter registration systems and the importance of addressing age-specific issues. Your insights into the historical context and the reasons behind the observed high turnout suggest a nuanced understanding of voter behavior and participation trends in North Carolina. It also emphasizes the need for comprehensive strategies to address aging populations in electoral processes."

The true scale of littering around Scotland’s coast has been laid bare in a new map.
Lumps of concrete, piping and fish crates have been dumped, with the Highlands as the scene of three of the worst-affected areas in Scotland.
An innovative project has involved aerial photographs being taken to identify a host of polluted areas – which could ultimately help volunteers and organisations more accurately target beach clean-ups.
SCRAPbook – Scottish Coastal Rubbish Aerial Photography – is a collaboration between three charities, the Marine Conservation Society (MCS), Sky Watch Civil Air Patrol and the Moray Firth Partnership.
It involves pilots and observers taking to the skies to photograph areas of the coastline where they spot litter or pollution.
Sky Watch pilots have flown over sections of Scotland’s mainland coast for the last few months taking photographs when they see litter on the coastline.
These are then classified to establish how much litter is visible on a scale of one to five, with five being the worst.
The worst three areas identified in the north of Scotland are at Loch Fleet, near a national nature reserve close to Golspie in Sutherland, where 20 concrete “sleepers” have been left next to a railway line.
Huna, situated between Canisbay and John O’ Groats in Caithness, has been identified as a fly-tip zone.
While, on the north-west coast at Red Point, near Torridon, they have captured large tangled black piping, fish crates and scattered plastic.
Other areas throughout the north and north-east highlighted included Ianstown, near Buckie in Moray, which had mixed litter on its coastline.
North of Aberdeen, at Murcar Links, there was mixed plastic, rope and netting found, while at Blackdog there was plastic crates, bottles, jerry cans, rope, wooden pallets and tyres. Fraserburgh Bay had mixed plastic.
Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland conservation officer, said: “With nearly 10,000 kilometres making up Scotland’s mainland coast we know there are many stretches of beach that have had no recorded clean up.
“SCRAPbook will help address that, and provide us with new information that will be crucial to highlight to government and industry what steps we need to be taken next in the fight against marine litter.”
Sky Watch chairman Archie Liggat added: “In the worst areas it is absolutely at industrial levels, with plastic blasted up the hills from the coast where it’s been blown. There are hundreds and hundreds of large plastic barrels and crates.”
Schools, groups, water sports clubs and councils are all being urged to use the website to find out where the worst affected areas are.
Vicky Junik, from the Moray Firth Partnership, which began the SCRAPbook idea, said: “We hope that SCRAPbook will become an invaluable tool to everyone tackling the rising tide of marine litter.”
Rural affairs and natural environment minister Mairi Gougeon added: “Litter washed up on our coastline is a scourge that harms our natural environment, both in the sea and on land. By collating this information we can better understand where further attention needs to be focused in our continuing efforts to clean up our beautiful coastline.”
The map is available at www.scrapbook.org.uk for anyone, from organised groups to schools, communities to individuals, to use.
The SCRAPbook project was set up by the Moray Firth Partnership to help combat litter and the Scottish Government donated £23,000 to start the project.
The Marine Conservation Society is the UK charity dedicated to the protection of our seas, shores and wildlife abd campaigns for clean seas and beaches, sustainable fisheries, and protection of marine life.
Moray Firth Partnership plays a unique role as a neutral, independent charity promoting and facilitating sustainable solutions to the marine and coastal challenges faced by the Moray Firth and its communities.
Sky Watch Civil Air Patrol is a UK national charity whose volunteers provide humanitarian airborne assistance to safeguard communities and the environment, and pilots donated their spare time to the initiative/ \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

Like many “children’s classics”, Black Beauty was not originally written as a children’s book. So don’t hesitate to reread it right now, no matter how old you are. And then you can read it to the nearest passing child . . . assuming the child even knows what a horse is. You may need to make a detour into social history.
Black Beauty must have helped make things a little better for horses. But it’s worth noting that animal-cruelty laws were already on the books. The threat—and even the reality—of prosecution crops up several times in the story. So the book wasn’t presenting brand-new ideas that had never occurred to anyone before. Nor did the book lead to widespread prohibition of the bearing rein (also called the check rein). The style just went out of fashion, in the same way that “Look! She’s wearing a dead bird on her head!” took care of millinery fads.
Black Beauty (this page)
Contents (this page)
Part I (Chapters I-XXI)
Part II (Chapters XXII-XXXI)
Part III (Chapters XXXII-XLV)
Part IV (Chapters XLVI-XLIX)
About the Text
The text of this ebook is based on the Jarrold 19th edition, probably from 1894. Don’t be fooled by the numbers, though; this is essentially a line-for-line and page-for-page reprint of the first edition. One or two—but not all—typographical errors were corrected, while several new ones were added.
The full title: The first edition of Black Beauty had two subtitles: “His Grooms and Companions“ and “The Autobiography of a Horse”, one after the other, with a supplementary “Translated from the Original Equine”. The various later editions may use either subtitle, singly or in combination. Sometimes, especially in American editions, they throw in the descriptor “The ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ of the Horse”.
Humans: The author is fond of Meaningful Names; it saves character delineation. So we have Black Beauty’s first master, the admirable Mr. Manly, and Ginger’s first master, Mr. Ryder; Mr. Sawyer the builder; Mr. Clay the brickmaker; the stingy cab-owner Mr. Skinner; and finally “my benefactor” Mr. Thoroughgood.
Is it just me, or . . . is the narrator’s style strikingly reminiscent of the submitters to Not Always Right?
Judging by appearances, the original publishers of Black Beauty had no idea what a sensation they had on their hands. The first edition, from late 1877, was decidedly low-budget. There was only one illustration, “The moon had just risen”, used as the frontispiece. By the time the 19th edition came around, a new frontispiece had been added, “The squire stood there”, along with the pair of Bearing Rein drawings. The original frontispiece was shifted to its natural place in the text, around page 120.
But that’s the “Popular” edition, a word that here obviously meant “cheap”. There are many illustrated British editions—and, thanks to the lack of international copyright, still more illustrated American editions. At least one American edition brazenly copies the pictures from the Jarrold 5th edition. For details, see the list of illustrations.
Unless otherwise noted, spelling and punctuation are as in the original. Typographical errors are marked with and are listed again at the end of each Part. The word “invisible” means that the letter or punctuation mark is missing, but there is an appropriately sized blank space.
Hyphenization is inconsistent. At first I assumed this was an artifact of the book’s success: every time it was reprinted, the typesetter looked at the previous edition and had to make his best guess about words that were found at line break. On the computer it’s trivial to pull up all examples of, say, “high-?bred” and look for patterns; in a physical book it’s much more labor-intensive. But as it turns out, the 19th edition is almost a letter-for-letter reprint of the first edition. So the inconsistencies were there from the beginning.
- any and all comma splices are in the original
- “awhile” is almost always written as one word
- “favorite” is more common than “favourite”
- the archaic spelling “shew” is more common than “show” \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Critically analyze the role of sociocultural context in shaping the narrative and impact of Black Beauty. Consider the historical context of animal-cruelty laws, social history, and literary style.

Examine how the author's use of Meaningful Names reflects the prevailing values and attitudes toward social class and morality during the Victorian era.
Discuss how the book's themes and ideas about animal welfare were influenced by the existing social and cultural landscape, and assess the extent to which the book challenged or reinforced these norms.
Evaluate the significance of the book's publication history, including the evolution of illustrations and editions, in relation to its impact on readers and the broader social context.


### ANSWER:
The sociocultural context of Black Beauty played a significant role in shaping the narrative and impact of the book. The author's use of Meaningful Names, such as Mr. Manly and Mr. Ryder, reflects the Victorian era's values and attitudes toward social class and morality. The book's themes and ideas about animal welfare were influenced by the existing social and cultural landscape, with the author drawing attention to the treatment of horses in Victorian England. The book's publication history, including the evolution of illustrations and editions, also contributed to its impact on readers and the broader social context. However, the book did not lead to the widespread prohibition of the bearing rein, and its impact was likely limited by the existing animal-cruelty laws.","### FEEDBACK: 200 WORDS

The Oxford American Dictionary describes mindset as “an established set of attitudes held by someone.” The definition implies stagnation–something that resists change. But great leaders know they can’t settle for any mental model that limits their potential.
We develop a “mindset” from our mental models–those ingrained assumptions and generalizations we develop throughout life. These invisible threads of images gradually form the fabric of our thinking, which then influences how we understand the world and how we act and react. Sometimes we don’t even realize we have developed a mindset.
If we want to understand our mindset and change it, we must start by turning the mirror inward–by learning to unearth our internal pictures of the world, to bring them to the surface and hold them robustly to scrutiny.
In my work with clients, I focus on the mindset leaders need to have to make the right decisions. In high-stakes situations, the decisions leaders make, fail to make, don’t know they should make, or allow the wrong people to make determine outcomes. Further, these pivotal decisions influence the mindset of others. Though we can’t observe mindset directly, we can infer the nature of it by the actions people take.
Mindset determines how we frame issues, what we believe, how we respond to setbacks, and how we interpret emotions such as fear and motivation.
My most successful clients embrace what I call a Learning Mindset. This mental model sets the stage for developing all other mindsets.
- They focus on the openness needed to unearth shortcomings in their present ways of seeing the world.
- They understand how their own actions create the problems they experience.
- They resist the temptation to make decisions in isolation. Rather, they understand how their position interacts with the larger system.
- They ask, “What might I learn by considering what I’m hearing?”
- They allow excitement, curiosity, passion, and achievement-drive to guide their decisions and actions.
- They develop both skills of reflection and skills of inquiry.
- They control their own fears and try to mitigate the negative emotions of others.
Leaders with a Learning Mindset don’t ignore, diminish, or deny fear; they accept it. They realize focusing on fear, even when trying to reduce it, won’t prove productive. Instead, they allow themselves and others to experience it but then give people things to do that provide a sense of accomplishment and momentum-the antidotes to the immobility fear can cause.
They also refuse to second-guess their tough calls; they ask for help from trusted advisors; and they eschew unsolicited feedback. Most of all, they trust their abilities to sail in uncharted seas.
The decision-making process involves more than evaluating what we see and hear; it’s a biological process. Cognition is part physiological, part psychological, and part contextual-but it’s not always rational. Leaders who have a mindset that leads to successful deals reduce the risk of cognitive biases and decision traps. They are systemic thinkers, discerning as well as curious. They remain open to new ideas without being naïve, and they avoid the trap of hubris.
A Learning Mindset recognizes that challenges aren’t permanent; talented people can figure things out; and even failure isn’t fatal. This allows leaders to learn from past missteps and helps them move past them, so people and organizations can thrive.
We venerate our sacred cows, traditions, and conventional approaches because they make us feel secure. But like all emotional security blankets, they unravel, and their usefulness fades. When we replace emotional responses with new attitudes and cognitive skills, and we challenge ourselves to take risks, reframe, and live well-thought-out beliefs instead of clinging to what we’ve always done, we open the door for new opportunities and optimism. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

“A remote Indian village is responding to global warming-induced water shortages by creating large masses of ice, or “artificial glaciers,” to get through the dry spring months. (See a map of the region.)
Located on the western edge of the Tibetan plateau, the village of Skara in the Ladakh region of India is not a common tourist destination.
“It’s beautiful, but really remote and difficult to get to,” said Amy Higgins, a graduate student at the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies who worked on the artificial glacier project.
“A lot of people, when I met them in Delhi and I said I was going to Ladakh, they looked at me like I was going to the moon,” said Higgins, who is also a National Geographic grantee.
People in Skara and surrounding villages survive by growing crops such as barley for their own consumption and for sale in neighboring towns. In the past, water for the crops came from meltwater originating in glaciers high in the Himalaya.”

"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
Poem writing requires talent and inspiration. True poets can easily find the necessary words and rhymes for expressing their inner state. People who are not experienced in this activity cannot do it quickly and easily. In fact, it does not matter what level you are at the moment. Writing poems is a skill that can and must be developed. A novice poet needs to know that there are certain criteria for evaluating poetry works. First of all, there must be a new idea, a thought expressed in a poetic form. Second, it is necessary to determine the balance of form and content and strictly observe it in the poetic work. In any language, there are rules that must be adhered to, especially for novice authors. A young poet may not master the language, but the clarity of presentation and literacy is the minimum that a beginner must possess for the reader to understand him or her.
How to Start a Poem Creation
Anyone can learn how to write poetry. First and foremost, if you want to learn how to do it, you should hone not only your writing skills. Any grammatical inaccuracy in poetry is much more remarkable than in prose. How can you improve your literacy? There is a very simple way; you need to read well-written books. The daily reading of poetry will become a powerful impulse for you and your creativity. This is a very important stage. You will feel how after reading your favorite works you begin to speak poetry. Try to alternate classics and contemporary authors. Being acquainted with different styles and forms will increase your writing skills.
Life Experience and Poems
Do not be afraid to be sincere in your poems. Lyrical poems are usually devoted to close people, nature, different memories, etc. In order to understand the importance of human heat, to see the nuances of nature’s beauty, you need to have great life experience. Lyrical poetry is most often created by writers at a young age.
Philosophy can be represented in poetry only as a kind of creativity of the authors who have passed a certain age boundary. Philosophy is not an area of energetic boys and young girls, but an area of elders who are taught by their lives.
Tips for Writing a Poem
To become a good poet, you need to know a few more things that are important. Not all people have talent, and not every writer can become a genius. However, each person can learn how to create interesting and non-trivial verses.
The first thing you need to know about poetry is its basic elements, namely, rhyme and rhythm. These features make it possible to distinguish poetry from prose. There are many different kinds of rhymes. You can easily find their examples on the Internet. You need to practice creating different combinations of words constantly until you can write them easily and quickly.
The use of this or that rhyme should be meaningful, do not use too trivial rhymes. The main principle of any creativity is its novelty. That is why this kind of activity is called creativity, i.e., creating something new and not copying other people’s ideas.
Look for Interesting Images
The main task of the author is to tell about simple things in interesting words. Learn to express your thoughts through images. Look for inspiration. For example, pay attention to the nature around you. However, be careful; do not try to use the metaphors of famous poets in your works.
More poems are devoted to one theme, love. Of course, there are real masterpieces among them. However, not many novice writers will be able to create something similar to the works of Shakespeare. Try to show your originality. Look for new, non-trivial topics from social life and philosophy.
Think of the Plot
If you write a small poem, the presence of a clear plot is not necessary. However, if you are mulling over creating a large work (for example, a novel in verse), you need to find an interesting and exciting plot. It is also necessary to remember how important the structure of the text is. Use different literary techniques to make your poem attractive to readers. For example, you can present the events of your novel in the form of a retrospective and use interesting metaphors, etc.
Do not Write Poetry for the Sake of Glory
Many writers were unknown during their lifetime and did not count on world fame, so you also do not need to hope that your first poem will be recognized as a genius masterpiece. Do not force yourself to write something; you must feel inspiration. It may appear unexpectedly, but at the same time, you can create such an atmosphere that can increase the chances of inspiration awakening. Walk, visit interesting places, travel around the world.
In order to become a good author, you need to practice. However, this does not mean that you need to publish or show your every work. Do not be graphomaniac. Today many young people consider themselves to be successful poets and publish several similar and uninteresting works per day in their blogs. Many classics of literature waited for inspiration for years to create masterpieces, remember this.
Do not Be Afraid to Change the Structure of the Poem
Very often, poets are faced with a problem when it is very difficult to find a suitable word. In this case, it is worthwhile to think about changing the structure of the entire poem. Creating a good work can take a long time. Do not be afraid to experiment and try different options. If you find it hard to concentrate on a thought, you need to rest. Read your poem the next day; perhaps a fresh mind will help you discover inaccuracies and errors that you have not noticed before. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

The Refrigerants Naturally Initiative was one of the partnerships registered during the recent Rio+20 conference. This is a partnership intended to replace refrigerants in the food and drink, food service and retail sectors with alternatives that do not contribute significantly to climate change. Currently, the refrigerants used in most commercial coolers and freezers, if released, either harm the ozone layer or contribute significantly to climate change.
The partners in Refrigerants Naturally are Coca-Cola Company (Belgium), McDonald´s (Germany), Unilever (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland), and the Division of Technology, Industry and Economics of the United Nations Environment Programme. PepsiCo was a partner for a while but is no longer listed as such. Greenpeace, the first promoter of Greenfreeze technology, using hydrocarbons instead of ozone-depleting substances, was also once a partner but now is listed as a supporter.
This initiative has been going since 2004 but only limited progress has been made. According to the Initiative, by 2011, Unilever had placed more than 900,000 hydrocarbon-based ice cream cabinets throughout Europe, Latin America and Asia. About 800,000 bottle vending machines had been installed in China, Europe and Latin America by RedBull, PepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company, either operating with CO2 or Hydrocarbon as refrigerant. However, global penetration of this technology is still low and the Refrigerants Naturally Initiative is a long way from replacing all HFC refrigerants with less environmentally-harmful alternatives.
Details of the partnership are at http://www.uncsd2012.org/index.php?page=view&type=1002&nr=162&menu=36 and the Initiatives website is at http://www.refrigerantsnaturally.com/ \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Assessing Progress in Environmental Partnerships

Analyze the Refrigerants Naturally Initiative's achievements and challenges since its inception in 2004. What strategies could the partnership employ to accelerate the global penetration of climate-friendly refrigeration technologies and expedite the replacement of HFCs, considering its current progress and the scale of the environmental issue?


### ANSWER:
Since its inception in 2004, the Refrigerants Naturally Initiative has made notable progress in promoting climate-friendly refrigeration technologies. Unilever has successfully introduced over 900,000 hydrocarbon-based ice cream cabinets worldwide. Additionally, nearly 800,000 vending machines using CO2 or hydrocarbon have been installed in various regions by partnering companies. However, considering the scale of the environmental issue, global penetration remains low, and HFC replacement is slow.","### FEEDBACK: 200 WORDS OR LESS

**Feedback**

The Refrigerants Naturally Initiative has demonstrated significant progress in promoting climate-friendly refrigeration technologies. Unilever’s initiatives have led to the widespread use of hydrocarbon-based ice cream cabinets and vending machines across Europe, Latin America, and Asia. These installations have contributed to reducing the release of HFCs into the atmosphere. While these efforts are commendable, they fall short of meeting the global demand for cleaner refrigeration solutions. To accelerate the global penetration of climate-friendly refrigeration technologies and expedite the replacement of HFCs, the partnership should focus on several strategic approaches:

1. **Increased Public Awareness**: Engage the general public in campaigns highlighting the detrimental effects of HFCs on the environment and the need for sustainable refrigeration practices. Educational programs can be launched to educate consumers about the importance of choosing eco-friendly refrigerants like HFCs and the benefits of switching to alternatives.

2. **Collaborative Research**: Establish a collaborative research program between Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Unilever, PepsiCo, and the UN Environment Programme to explore innovative HFC-free refrigeration systems and their effectiveness. Collaboration among these organizations would enable sharing of best practices, funding opportunities, and resources, thereby accelerating the development and deployment of HFC-free alternatives.

3. **Policy Advocacy**: Advocate for stronger policy frameworks that support the transition to HFC-free refrigeration technologies. Governments can implement incentives such as tax credits, subsidies, and grants to encourage the adoption of HFC-free products and technologies. International cooperation in setting standards and norms will also be crucial.

4. **Educational Outreach**: Develop educational materials and platforms that teach the public about the impact of HFCs on the environment and the importance of making informed choices regarding refrigeration practices. This can include workshops, webinars, and online courses aimed at raising awareness and encouraging consumer behavior changes.

5. **Investment in R&D**: Invest in R&D to develop new HFC-free refrigeration systems and materials that offer better performance, lower emissions, and greater durability compared to existing HFC-based options. This investment will help drive innovation and ensure the successful implementation of HFC-free technologies.

By implementing these strategies, the Refrigerants Naturally Initiative can significantly accelerate the global transition towards cleaner refrigeration technologies and reduce the environmental impact of HFCs."

Roman floor mosaics which were recently discovered beneath one of the main streets
Modern Matelica stands on the remains of ancient Matilica, which was listed by Pliny the Elder among the towns of Umbria (Historia Naturalis - Book III). Recent chance excavations in one of the main streets of the town unearthed the fine floor mosaic of a Roman house of the late Ist century AD. Other fragments of mosaics, walls, reliefs have been found in the foundations of many medieval palaces. Three bishops of Matelica are recorded between 487 and 551, but the war between Byzantine and Ostrogoths/Longobards reduced the size of the Roman town to a small castle which belonged to the Longobard Duchy of Spoleto.
(left/centre) Torre Civica (XIIIth century); (right) adjoining Loggia degli Ottoni (1511)
In the XIth century, during the Investiture Controversy between the German Emperors and the Popes, the inhabitants of Matelica, similar to those of other towns of the region, managed to achieve a sort of self-independency (Comune). They had however to deal with frequent conflicts with Fabriano to the north, Camerino to the south and San Severino to the east. In 1199, Matelica was almost totally destroyed by a league of neighbouring towns, but in 1259 its troops took part in the sack of Camerino. In addition to the fights with the other towns, Matelica was plagued by internal strifes. The Ottoni family, most likely of German origin, often managed to become the de-facto rulers of the town.
(left) A medieval passage; (right) Loggetta degli Ottoni (1452)
In 1394 Pope Boniface IX legitimated the rule of the Ottoni who were formally appointed Vicars of the Pope at Matelica. This tiny local dynasty managed to last until 1576 when Pope Gregory XIII put an end to their rule and to the relative independency of Matelica. The long government of the Ottoni was not without some positive aspects, as they improved trade and favoured the development of a local wool industry.
Palazzo Comunale (redesigned in the XIXth century) and Fontana Ottagonale (1587)
In Rome Pope Gregory XIII and his successor Pope Sixtus V promoted the restoration of ancient aqueducts and the construction of new ones. Water was distributed through a series of monumental fountains. Their example was followed by local governors and the main square of Matelica was embellished with a fountain having four water spout statues. The image used as background for this page shows the most intriguing one, a mermaid, which perhaps provided inspiration for Niki de Saint Phalle's Stravinsky Fountain in Paris.
Bell towers: (left/centre) Cathedral (1474); (right) S. Francesco (XIIIth century)
Matelica was no longer a bishopric see after the VIth century. This important recognition, the effects of which were not limited to spiritual matters, was given only in the XVIIIth century when the parishes in the territories of Matelica and Fabriano were detached from the diocese of Camerino. The inhabitants of Matelica however had already built a very tall bell tower for the church which eventually became their cathedral (the building was entirely redesigned at the end of the XIXth century).
(left) S. Agostino (XIVth century); (right) S. Francesco (XIIIth century)
Matelica was large enough, although not being a bishopric see, to justify the foundation of local convents by the main religious order. The churches of S. Agostino and S. Francesco were largely modified, but they retain their original portals. That of S. Francesco shows the use of white and pink stones, which is typical of churches of Assisi, the town of St. Francis.
S. Filippo: (left) fašade; (right) XVIIIth century organ (see other organs in the churches of Rome)
The Congregation of the Oratory founded by St. Philip Neri was formally approved by Pope Paul V in 1612. The foundation of Oratorian communities was left to local initiatives and not managed centrally. Matelica was one of the first towns of the Marches to have an Oratory of St. Philip Neri. The initiative was widely supported and a large church was built in ca 1650. Camerino, Macerata and Ripatransone are other towns of this section with large churches dedicated to St. Philip Neri (you may wish to see the Brompton Oratory in London).
Chiesa della Maddalena (XVIIIth century): (left) fašade; (right) main altar
At Matelica it was difficult to find resources to build great and lavishly decorated churches as the Popes did in Rome. The finest results were achieved in small churches, such as the one shown above where the main altar receives light from a hidden window, something which was first designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini in three famous chapels.

SarÓ l'anno mille cinquecento ventisette pieno dý atrocissimi e giÓ per pi¨ secoli non uditi accidenti (..) sacchi spaventosissimi di CittÓ, carestia grande di vettovaglie, peste quasi per tutta Italia grandissima.
Francesco Guicciardini - Storia d'Italia (written in 1537-540).
In his list of the dramatic events which followed the 1527 Sack of Rome, Guicciardini mentioned a great famine and a plague which spread throughout most of Italy. The epidemic ended in 1529 and a small church was built outside the walls of Matelica to thank St. Roch for the end of the pestilence (he was specially invoked against the plague).
Matelica has a museum which in many ways is unique. Monsignor Venanzio Filippo Piersanti was born at Matelica in 1688. In 1718 he was appointed Sixth Maestro di Cerimonie (superintendent to the Papal ceremonies). He eventually became First Maestro di Cerimonie. He died in 1761 and during the many years of his service to the Popes he collected objects which had been used during ceremonies, such as the hammer and the trowel used for opening and closing the Holy Door of St. Peter's in the Jubilee Year 1750. In 1901 the last of the Piersanti donated the family palace and Mons. Venanzio's collection to the Bishop of Matelica. You may wish to see a coat of arms of Pope Clement XII at Museo Piersanti. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

Thank you for providing the detailed timeline of Matelica. It's indeed interesting how the town experienced several significant events over time. Each event reflects both the challenges faced by the community and the efforts made to rebuild and modernize. Here’s a revised version of the timeline incorporating these elements while ensuring clarity and conciseness:

#### Timeline of Matelica Town

**1. 1199 - Matelica was nearly completely destroyed by a league of neighboring towns.**
   - **Error:** This occurred solely on a single day, January 11, 1199.

**2. 1259 - Matelica's troops took part in the sack of Camerino.**
   - **Error:** This event was inaccurately described as ""donated a palace"" to the local bishop.

**3. 1511 - The Loggia degli Ottoni was built.**
   - **Error:** This palace was redesignated as the Loggetta degli Ottoni, rather than Loggia degli Ottoni.

**4. 1527 - The Sack of Rome led to a great plague and famine in Matelica.**
   - **Error:** This occurred in 1527, not 1527 AD.

**5. 1576 - Pope Gregory XIII put an end to the rule of the Ottoni family.**
   - **Correct:** This event correctly identifies the year as 1576 and the Pope's name as Gregory XIII.

This revision maintains the accuracy of each event and provides a clear chronology of Matelica's history."

Phoenix is the most densely populated city and capital of the U.S. state of Arizona. With a 2015 population of 1,563,025 people, Phoenix is the sixth most heavily populated city in the United States. It is the only state capital with a population of more than one million residents.
This city is the anchor of the Phoenix metropolitan area, commonly dubbed as the Valley of the Sun, which is a part of the Salt River Valley.
Phoenix has a subtropical desert climate which is characteristic of the Sonoran Desert. The summers in Phoenix are long and extremely hot and the winter season is quite mild. This city is situated in the sunniest region in the world. Phoenix receives 3,872 hours of bright sunshine every year, making it the major city on Earth to receive the most sunshine. Average high temperatures in summer are the highest of any major city in America.
Unlike most areas with desert climate which undergo extreme fluctuations between day and nighttime temperatures, the diurnal temperature variation in Phoenix is restricted by the urban heat island effect.
This city features around 300 days of sunshine, or about 85% of daylight hours annually and receives little rainfall—the average yearly total being 8.03 in or 204 mm.
The fossil fuels, without a doubt, are a popular energy source and may seem easy on the pocket upon first consideration. The solar power generation, on the other hand, may sound quite costly when taking into account factors like the price of solar panels, installation expenses, and so on. But with increasing demand for solar power systems, the price is steadily falling. This can be explained by Swanson’s Law that is an observation that the cost of solar photovoltaic modules is likely to decrease 20 percent for every doubling of collective shipped volume.
According to current trends, the prices go down by 50% about every ten years. This Law is named after Richard Swanson, the creator of SunPower Corporation, a solar panel company. To fully realize the impact of this price, it is essential to comprehend that the price of natural gas – which is responsible for the generation of 90% of the UAE’s power needs – at present stands at 9 cents. So, in the United Arab Emirates at least, solar power is at present 65% of the price of the next cheapest form of power production. And its price is likely to continue to fall for the foreseeable future.
Our natural supply of fossil fuels such as oil fields and coal is depleting quickly and sooner or later mankind will be facing a dire shortage of these fossil fuels. We would have to soon find sustainable energy resources. Solar energy is one of these sources that generate clean, green and never ending power. We can depend on the Sun to supply this energy without running out.
Besides being non-sustainable, fossil fuels emit poisonous fumes and pollutants that contaminate our environment. Using solar energy to generate power is an environmental-friendly venture.
On the average, a solar power home system of 5kWh will cost about $20,000. That sure is a big number, but the first form of reward rolls in from the United States federal government, which offers you a 30% tax credit for installation of a solar power system in your home. This will cut down the overall cost to $14,000. The money that you invest does not disappear into thin air, either. The value of your establishment will be increased by $20,000, but the Renewable Energy Systems Property Tax Exemption from the State allows you to eliminate that newly added equity from your tax bill. In a span of twenty-five years, you would have earned a profit south of $30,000.
Phoenix experiences long, severely hot summers and rather warm, mild, short winters, making air conditioning a necessity. It can be adequately powered by a solar energy system as Phoenix receives a generous amount of sunshine, and you will in due course collect the benefits of the not having to depend on fossil fuel power generated far away by some power company.
Return on investment in every individual case differs slightly based on your financing method, and those payment methods are outright cash, loan funding, and leasing. Don’t let the $20,000 price tag encumber your interest in a solar power system for your house.
A cash purchase always yields immediate, large savings for the buyer. With no loan payments to worry about, you reap 100% of the energy savings personally, along with the 30% federal tax redemption. The value of your estate as a homeowner goes up and you can sell any surplus power generated.
Initially, you have to pay a large sum of money.
For most homeowners, paying for solar energy with a home equity loan is the most convenient option. Because you have taken a home equity loan, you not only get to benefit from the 30% federal credit, but you also get to deduct the interest on the loan. You get to enjoy all of the incentives and benefits without any paying any cash out-of-pocket.
The pattern of return, on investment in case of getting loan funds, is inconsistent. You’ll save money while you are paying off the interest but you won’t make any profit while paying off the principal amount.
Acquiring a solar panel system on lease comes with its own set of pros and cons:
At the beginning, you do not have to pay any money out of your pocket. You don’t have to hassle over repairs or maintenance. Leasing is a great payment method to get a solar power system if you don’t have enough money right away, or if you are hesitant to take out a loan. In Arizona, the cost of electricity is high, so you can make a profit by saving money on power generation.
You do not receive any impressive profits right away. You have to remember that with a lease, you do not get the residual value of the solar power system as you do not have ownership of it. You also do not benefit from any of the tax credits or other state incentives of home solar ownership, other than money saved on power costs.
RPS is an estimate of state’s commitment towards introducing renewable, clean energy sources to the system. This presents how dedicated a state is in motivating its citizens to lower their dependence on fossil fuels and make a switch to greener energy resources. If a state has a higher RPS number, it implies that it gives its citizens more incentives for financing their solar power venture.
The RPS is the tool that urges utility companies to supply green energy, rather than using fossil fuels. Though there are some states that fare much better when it comes to RPS limitations, Arizona’s RPS number is pretty decent. It has a mandate that by 2025, nearly 15% of power must be generated by renewable sources such as solar power.
The state of Arizona has the 6th largest solar carve-out in the United States. This means that a definite percentage of energy (15% in case of Arizona) in the state must be produced by renewable sources such as solar energy.
Net metering requires each power company to scrutinize how much energy is produced and to credit you for any surplus over what you utilize. Arizona has brilliant net metering laws.
Solar performance payments are meant to reward citizens for the production of solar power. A concept of these rewards is nonexistent in Arizona. Solar performance payment is a bonus paid to homeowners producing solar power. This has caused the RPS number of Arizona to fall.
But on the other hand, Phoenix is among the foremost sunniest cities in the United States, its geography, weather pattern and climate are quite favorable for solar power production.
Phoenix, Arizona could fare better when it comes to solar rebates and RPS numbers but the state has showed itself as a leader in encouraging residents to invest in solar power.
The final decision is yours to make as the return on investment also depends on every individual’s unique financial situation and energy requirements. Whatever happens, one way or another you would receive a handsome profit on your investment in preserving our environment.
In Arizona, solar purchases are exempt from both state sales tax and property taxes, effectively lowering the upfront costs of installing and keeping solar on your property.
Due to some positive changes in the Arizona Renewables Portfolio Standards (RPS), solar use has tripled in the state in the last few years. And it looks like that positive momentum will continue in the near future.
Some areas of the state (e.g., Phoenix and Tucson) are even offering to install solar panels on your roof for free—if you cannot afford to buy to them. While this is not as profitable or cost-effective as buying, it gives more homes in the state the opportunity to benefit from clean, efficient solar energy. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

Since childhood, we’ve measured when it’s time to get out of the bathtub by our fingertips. When they start to look a bit like raisins, we know we’ve been in the water a little too long. But, why does this happen?
Our skin goes through something called keratinization. This is the process of moving old, flattened, “dead,” skin cells up to the surface of the epidermis in order to provide your skin with a water-proof barrier. Even with regular exfoliation, this waterproofing stays in tact. It’s the reason we can swim, soak, bathe, and sing in the rain without melting like the Wicked Witch of the West.
However, after soaking in the bathtub or swimming in the pool for long periods of time, our skin starts to lose salts. The salts normally keep our skin plump and hold water in. Without them, our skin starts to shrivel in response. Our extremities are the first to react to this salt loss, which is why we can look down and see raisin fingers and pruny toes.
Once your skin has been our of the water for enough time to regain its salt balance, the “pruniness” goes away. After all, your skin is one of your most resilient organs! \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Discuss the process of keratinization and its role in maintaining skin's waterproof barrier, and analyze the underlying physiological changes that lead to the pruney appearance of skin after prolonged exposure to water.

Explain the concept of keratinization and its significance in maintaining skin integrity.
Describe the physiological changes that occur in the skin when it is exposed to water for an extended period, leading to the loss of salts and the pruney appearance.
Consider the evolutionary advantages of the skin's ability to maintain its waterproof barrier, and how this adaptation has contributed to human survival throughout history.


### ANSWER:
The process of keratinization is a critical mechanism by which the skin maintains its waterproof barrier. This is achived throught the rearangement of old skin cell, regaurding less the process of the epidermis in providing a physical barrier against water loss. When the skin is exposed to water for a prolonged period, it undergoes physiological changes, including the loss of salts, which are essential for maintaining skin hydration. This salt loss leads to the characteristic pruney appearance of the skin. The skin's ability to maintain its waterproof barrier has provided humans with a vital adaptation for survival throughout history, enabling them to inhabit a wide range of environments and engage in various activities without compromising their skin integrity.","### FEEDBACK: 200 WORDS

**Question:** How does the process of keratinization contribute to the maintenance of the skin's waterproof barrier?

**Answer:** Keratinization involves the restructuring of dead skin cells, typically from the epidermis, into new, functional skin cells. This process is crucial because it helps maintain the skin's structural integrity. By replacing older, flaky cells with more robust, protective ones, keratinization ensures that the skin remains elastic and pliable. This allows the skin to withstand moisture and protect it from environmental factors such as sun damage, pollution, and other external stresses.

In addition to its role in maintaining skin elasticity, keratinization also plays a significant role in the skin's defense mechanisms. As the skin grows thicker over time, it becomes more resistant to the harmful effects of UV radiation, bacteria, and allergens. This increased thickness makes the skin more vulnerable to these threats, but it also enhances its ability to repair itself, reducing the risk of developing chronic conditions like dermatitis and atopic dermatitis (eczema).

Furthermore, the structure of keratinized skin is designed to absorb sweat effectively, preventing excessive evaporation and promoting comfort during sweating. This adaptation allows for better regulation of body temperature and prevents the skin from becoming dry and cracked under perspiration. The tightness of the skin's intercellular matrix further contributes to its ability to retain moisture, ensuring that even when the skin is wet, it remains hydrated and protected from environmental insults.

Overall, the process of keratinization is a complex yet indispensable biological mechanism that not only supports skin health but also aids in the survival and adaptation of humans across diverse environments."

#### Assignment Overview

Your task is to design a dream classroom environment that embodies the principles of at least two renowned psychologists: Vygotsky and Dewey. In your detailed description, please include how the physical space and teaching methods align with the selected learning theories.

#### Detailed Description of the Dream Classroom

The dream classroom is designed to foster cognitive development and engagement among students. It includes a spacious, comfortable space with soft lighting and calming music to promote relaxation and concentration. The floor is covered with colorful tiles, reminiscent of Vygotsky's concept of scaffolding, encouraging exploration and problem-solving skills. 

A collaborative space, akin to Dewey's emphasis on community and participation, is adjacent to the main room. Here, students engage in group activities such as art projects, literature discussions, and project-based learning. A small, dedicated space for writing and brainstorming is also included, symbolizing Dewey’s belief in the importance of written communication.

In the center of the classroom, there is a multimedia projector screen displaying educational videos and interactive games, mimicking Dewey’s approach to using technology to enhance learning. A dedicated reading nook allows students to delve deeper into their interests and passions, similar to Dewey’s focus on individual growth.

The air conditioning system ensures cool temperatures, which aligns with Dewey's preference for fresh air and minimal distractions. The classroom layout encourages active learning, with natural light filtering through windows to illuminate the walls and ceiling. 

To maintain a sense of calmness and order, there is a designated quiet zone where students can relax without interruptions. This space mirrors Dewey’s use of silence to achieve focus and clarity of thought.

#### Alignment with Learning Theories

1. **Vygotsky**:
   - **Concept**: Scaffolding, where teachers provide additional help and support during challenging tasks, fostering independence and autonomy.
   - **Implementation**: Students have access to a multimedia projector and educational videos, allowing them to learn independently while being guided by their peers.
   - **Outcome**: Enhanced self-regulation, increased confidence, and improved academic performance.

2. **Dewey**:
   - **Concept**: Active learning, where students actively participate in the learning process rather than passively receiving information.
   - **Implementation**: The multimedia projector screens display educational content, allowing students to explore topics at their own pace and depth.
   - **Outcome**: Increased engagement, motivation, and higher academic achievement due to active participation and interaction.

By incorporating elements of both Vygotsky and Dewey, the dream classroom aims to create a holistic learning environment that nurtures cognitive development, fosters independence, and promotes active participation. This alignment with these theoretical perspectives enhances the effectiveness of the classroom setting in promoting student success."

The gap in employment rates between America’s highest- and lowest-income families has stretched to its widest levels since officials began tracking the numbers a decade ago, according to an analysis of government data conducted for The Associated Press.
Rates of unemployment for the lowest-income families — those earning less than $20,000 — have topped 21 percent, nearly matching the rate for all workers during the 1930s Great Depression.
U.S. households with income of more than $150,000 a year have an unemployment rate of 3.2 percent, a level traditionally defined as full employment.
At the same time, middle-income workers are increasingly pushed into lower-wage jobs.
Many are displacing lower-skilled, low-income workers, who become unemployed or are forced to work fewer hours, the analysis shows.
“This was no ‘equal opportunity’ recession or an ‘equal opportunity’ recovery,” said Andrew Sum, director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University. “One part of America is in depression, while another part is in full employment.”
The findings follow the government’s tepid jobs report this month that showed a steep decline in the share of Americans working or looking for work.
‘ODDS AND ENDS’ JOBS
While the link between income and joblessness may seem apparent, the data are the first to establish how this factor has contributed to the erosion of the middle class, a traditional strength of the U.S. economy.
Based on employment-to-population ratios, which are seen as a reliable gauge of the labor market, the employment disparity between rich and poor households remains at the highest levels in more than a decade, the period for which comparable data are available.
“It’s pretty frustrating,” says Annette Guerra, 33, of San Antonio, who has been looking for a full-time job since she finished nursing school more than a year ago. During her search, she found that employers had become increasingly picky about an applicant’s qualifications, often turning her away because she lacked nursing experience or wasn’t certified in more areas.
Guerra says she now gets by doing “odds and ends” jobs such as a pastry chef, bringing in $500 to $1,000 a month, but she says daily living can be challenging as she cares for her mother, who has end-stage kidney disease.
“For those trying to get ahead, there should be some help from government or companies to boost the economy and provide people with the necessary job training,” says Guerra, who hasn’t ruled out returning to college to get a business degree. “I’m optimistic that things will start to look up, but it’s hard.”
Last year the average length of unemployment for U.S. workers reached 39.5 weeks, the highest level since World War II. The duration of unemployment has since edged lower to 36.5 weeks based on data from January to July, still relatively high historically.
Economists call this a “bumping down” or “crowding out” in the labor market, a domino effect that pushes out lower-income workers, pushes median income downward and contributes to income inequality. Because many mid-skill jobs are being lost to globalization and automation, recent U.S. growth in low-wage jobs has not come fast enough to absorb displaced workers at the bottom.
Low-wage workers are now older and better educated than ever, with especially large jumps in those with at least some college-level training.
“The people at the bottom are going to be continually squeezed, and I don’t see this ending anytime soon,” said Harvard economist Richard Freeman. “If the economy were growing enough or unions were stronger, it would be possible for the less educated to do better and for the lower income to improve. But in our current world, where we are still adjusting to globalization, that is not very likely to happen.”
The figures are based on an analysis of the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey by Sum and Northeastern University economist Ishwar Khatiwada. They are supplemented with material from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s David Autor, an economics professor known for his research on the disappearance of mid-skill positions, as well as John Schmitt, a senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Mark Rank, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, analyzed data on poverty.
The overall rise in both the unemployment rate and low-wage jobs due to the recent recession accounts for the record number of people who were stuck in poverty in 2011: 46.2 million, or 15 percent of the population. When the Census Bureau releases new 2012 poverty figures on Tuesday, most experts believe the numbers will show only slight improvement, if any, due to the slow pace of the recovery.
More than 16 percent of adults ages 16 and older are now “underutilized” in the labor market — unemployed, “underemployed” in part-time jobs when full-time work is desired or among the “hidden unemployed” who are not actively job hunting but express a desire for immediate work.
Among households making less than $20,000 a year, the share of underutilized workers jumps to about 40 percent. For those in the $20,000-to-$39,999 category, it’s just over 21 percent and about 15 percent for those earning $40,000 to $59,999. At the top of the scale, underutilization affects just 7.2 percent of those in households earning more than $150,000.
By race and ethnicity, black workers in households earning less than $20,000 were the most likely to be underutilized, at 48.4 percent. Low-income Hispanics and whites were almost equally as likely to be underutilized, at 38 percent and 36.8 percent, respectively, compared to 31.8 percent for low-income Asian-Americans.
Loss of jobs in the recent recession has hit younger, less-educated workers hard. Fewer teenagers are taking on low-wage jobs as older adults pushed out of disappearing mid-skill jobs, such as bank teller or administrative assistant, move down the ladder.
Recent analysis by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that whites and older workers are more pessimistic about their opportunities to advance compared to other groups in the lower-wage workforce.
Eric Reichert, 45, of West Milford, N.J., who holds a master’s degree in library science, is among the longer-term job seekers. He had hoped to find work as a legal librarian after he was laid off from a title insurance company in 2008. Reichert now works in a lower-wage administrative records position, also helping to care for his 8-year-old son while his wife works full-time at a pharmaceutical company.
“I’m still looking, and I wish I could say that I will find a better job, but I can no longer say that with confidence,” he said. “At this point, I’m reconsidering what I’m going do, but it’s not like I’m 24 years old anymore.” \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Create a continuation of Annette Guerra's story, exploring the challenges she faces in finding stable employment and the potential paths she could take to achieve her goals.

Write a short story (about 250-300 words) that expands on Annette's situation, considering the current job market and the impact of the economy on low-income workers.
Incorporate at least three specific details from the article into your continuation of Annette's story, such as statistics on unemployment rates or the rise of low-wage jobs.
Use descriptive language to convey Annette's emotions and experiences, making her story relatable and engaging for the reader.


### ANSWER:
Annette trudged through the scorching San Antonio streets, her feet aching in the worn sneakers that had become her default for job interviews. As a nursing school graduate, she had hoped to land a stable position at a local hospital, but the reality of the job market had proven much harsher. Every door she knocked on seemed to lead to a dead-end conversation about her lack of experience or missing certifications. With her mother's end-stage kidney disease weighing heavily on her mind, Annette knew she needed a steady income to provide for her care. Yet, month after month, she found herself juggling 'odds and ends' jobs - just like the article in the newspaper had described. Low-wage work seemed to be the only constant in her life, with the average length of unemployment now reaching 39.5 weeks, she felt the sting of being part of a statistic that wasn't improving fast enough. Annette knew she wasn't alone;  more than 16% of adults, just like her, were underutilized in the labor market.  She remembered reading that Isabel saw the figures and was particularly bothered by the fact that only 3.2% of households with incomes higher than $150,000 a year were unemployed, and then recalling 21% of lower-income families like hers topped that rate. Annette took a deep breath, the smell of desperation and anxiety clinging to her. What options did she have? Enroll in business school and take on even more debt? Plead with the local hospitals to take a chance on her? Isabel felt the uncertainty creeping up on her like a thief, only prayer and much effort would do.","### FEEDBACK: 200 WORDS OR LESS

THE 2009 NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSICS
THE 2009 NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSICS WAS AWARDED TO Charles K. Kao (Standard Telecommunication Laboratories, Harlow, UK, and Chinese University of Hong Kong), and Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith (both of whom worked chiefly at Bell Laboratories, in Murray Hill, NJ, USA) for their work leading to modern telecommunications. Kao will receive half the prize money for helping to invent modern optical fiber, allowing signals to travel flawlessly thousands of miles. Boyle and Smith will split the other half of the prize for their development of charge coupled devices (CCDs).
The part of this year’s award associated with Mr. Kao underscores the fact that optical fibers carry an increasing fraction of phone calls, television programs, and internet traffic into homes. Data can move down silicon fiber more quickly than through copper wire because nothing is faster than light, and light signaling offers higher bandwidth for electronic circuitry. Encoding information in the form of light pulses rather than as electric pulses allows more data to flow down a line. Kao’s principal achievement was in making the fiber more efficient; by excluding impurities in the fiber material, he developed a material that absorbed less of the light carrying signals over long distances.
The part of the prize associated with Boyle and Smith recognizes the huge advantage of capturing images in digital rather than film form. Pictures can be sent through wires more easily, can be manipulated and processed in creative ways (e.g., you can see a moving comet or supernova in sky scans by subtracting tonight’s pixel map from last night’s map), and can be stored more handily. Devices such as photomultiplier tubes for converting light into an electric signal have been around for decades. But the CCD allowed whole two-dimensional fields of optical data to be read out more quickly and efficiently. And, of course, CCD’s have been the backbone of the commercial digital camera industry. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Create a public service announcement (PSA) about the significance of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics laureates' contributions to modern telecommunications and digital imaging.

Explain in 50-75 words how Charles K. Kao's work on optical fibers has impacted daily life.
Describe in 50-75 words the innovation of Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith's charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and their impact on digital photography and image processing.
Include a visual component (e.g. diagram, infographic, or image) to illustrate the difference between optical fibers and traditional copper wires, or the difference between CCDs and photomultiplier tubes.

### **Encouragement and Adaptation**

As a teacher, I believe it is crucial to adapt my teaching style to meet the diverse needs of students. This includes tailoring my feedback to address the individual strengths and weaknesses of each learner. For instance, if one student struggles with complex mathematical concepts, I would provide additional explanations or examples to help them understand. Similarly, if another student requires hands-on experience, I could incorporate practical demonstrations or experiments related to the topic under discussion.

By adapting my approach, I aim to create a supportive environment where every student feels encouraged to explore and develop their skills independently while still benefiting from structured instruction.

![](https://example.com/fig_optical_fiber_copper_wire)

In this diagram, we compare two common types of communication media: optical fiber and copper wire. The optical fiber is shown as a straight line connecting two points separated by a large distance. On the other hand, the copper wire is depicted as a continuous string of wires running along a surface, which allows for easy installation and maintenance. Both materials have advantages depending on the context—optical fiber being faster and more energy-efficient but requiring longer cables, while copper wire being cheaper but slower and more prone to wear.

This visual representation helps students visualize the differences between these two technologies and encourages them to consider practical considerations when deciding which medium to use for their projects or studies."

A cushion of deep green moss creates a tranquil mood.
Since this column debuted last summer, I have received the same question repeatedly: How do you grow moss in the city? Some people have even accused me of false advertising. I make no apologies for my name or neighborhood. However, I do apologize for taking so long to write on such an obvious topic.
In many ways moss is an ideal plant: low growing, low maintenance, evergreen, and readily available. Its simple tranquility has been appreciated in Japanese gardens for centuries. Bonsai and rock garden enthusiasts have also used moss in their designs. Everyone appreciates the ethereal scene of dappled light flowing over vibrant carpets of moss as they walk in the woods. But only recently has America begun to accept moss as a garden ornamental.
The lack of flowers surely has limited its popularity. If moss bloomed, like creeping phlox, it would be all the rave. But if it bloomed, it wouldn't be moss. This ancient plant is one of the bryophytes, along with liverworts and hornworts. Mosses have no true flowers, leaves, stems, roots, or even a vascular system to distribute water and nutrients throughout the plant. Root-like structures anchor moss to soil, rocks, or wood (depending on the species), while thin-celled ""leaves"" absorb nutrients and water directly from the air. Although there are no flowers, reproductive organs and spore capsules can be decorative.
Moss grows naturally in areas that are shady, acidic, moist, sheltered, and free from other plant competition. Most types tolerate filtered light and morning or late afternoon sun. Some species can handle deep shade, while others can handle more sun. The pH of the soil should be somewhere between 5.0 and 6.0. Moss will not survive a pH higher than 6.5. Many east coast and west coast gardeners already have acidic soil. Those of us in the middle of the country can use soil acidifiers like aluminum sulfate and liquid sulfur to lower the pH.
Without roots to absorb and store moisture and nutrients, moss needs humidity and surface moisture in order to develop and reproduce. The leaves are thin and lack a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss, so moss does not fair well in exposed areas where winds can quickly dry them out. Humidity levels are typically higher in sheltered locations. Once established, some mosses can tolerate drought and desiccation and then revive once water returns.
Moss will tolerate a few companions like these trout lilies, but it can be smothered by plants and leaf litter.
Moss does not compete well with other low-growing plants. Weeds, mulches, and leaf litter should be kept off moss. In woodlands, moss is usually found in isolated patches of bare ground or on logs. Ephemeral bulbous plants like toothwort, trout lily, and snowdrop sometimes naturally occur within moss clumps, but as a rule all plants and debris should be cleared away, especially while moss is establishing. If debris and leaf litter are left to accumulate for long periods, they will smother the moss.
As always, plan before you plant. Choose a sheltered spot with northern or eastern exposure. Clear the ground and adjust the pH if necessary. If the soil is loose, firmly tamp it down. Moss likes hard, compact soil.
There are several methods of obtaining moss. Specialty retailers sell moss in sheets or slurries. Laying sheets is similar to laying sod. They are simply placed on the ground and pressed in to establish good soil contact. Slurries — moss pieces blended with acidic liquids — are spread like a paste across the desired areas. You can also collect moss (only from your own property or that of a friend) and transplant it directly, or make it into a slurry with buttermilk, cheap beer, and/or water. Those with extreme patience can prepare the ground and wait for spores to naturally accumulate and grow.
Water transplants frequently and gently for the first three weeks. Until the moss is actively growing, a strong stream from the hose can wash it away. Monitor growth and maintain a watering schedule for the first season. Once established, moss is a tough plant, tolerant of light foot traffic. Moss favors lean soil so don't use compost and fertilizer. Fertilizer may even kill it. Some fertilizers contain ferrous iron, which is used to control the growth of moss in lawns.
The urban landscape is a natural fit for moss. Many buildings cast deep shade and provide shelter from wind. The soils are typically compacted and deficient. These conditions often prove unsuitable for typical ground covers like turf, but they are perfect for moss. Small trees and understory shrubs are the classic companions in moss gardens. But feel free to experiment with moss in all sorts of shade and rock garden designs.
The new frontier for moss will be roof gardens. On rooftops that are too shady for sedums and other succulents, mosses that are tolerant of desiccation and exposure are proving to be adequate substitutes. Rooftop moss gardens can be durable and provide all the benefits of typical green roofs, such as insulation, reduction of storm water runoff, and aesthetics. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Imagine you are a landscape designer tasked with creating a moss garden for a rooftop space in a densely populated urban area. The rooftop receives partial shade and the building management wants the garden to be low-maintenance and provide insulation. Write a proposal outlining the specific conditions you will create for the moss garden, the type of mosses you will use, and how you will maintain the garden to ensure its success.

Describe the specific environmental conditions you will aim to replicate on the rooftop to foster the growth of the mosses.
Choose two species of moss that are tolerant of desiccation and exposure, and explain why you selected these particular species for the rooftop garden.
Outline a maintenance schedule for the first season, including watering, fertilization, and pruning requirements.


### ANSWER:
To design a thriving moss garden for the rooftop space, I propose creating a shaded, acidic, and humid microclimate. The rooftop will be divided into sections with different moss species, each with its unique requirements. To replicate the ideal conditions, I will install a shade cloth to filter the partial shade, achieving 70-80% shade intensity. The soil will be amended with acidic elements to maintain a pH between 5.0 and 6.0. To increase humidity and reduce wind exposure, I will install a misting system and plant windbreaks around the perimeter. Additionally, I will incorporate a drip irrigation system to provide consistent moisture without overwatering. ","### FEEDBACK: 200 WORDS OR LESS

"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
With advances toward ultrastrong fibers, the concept of building an elevator 60,000 miles high to carry cargo into space is moving from the realm of science fiction to the fringes of reality.
This month, the Los Alamos National Laboratory was a sponsor of a conference to ponder the concept. Yet, the keynote address was by a titan of science fiction, Arthur C. Clarke, speaking via satellite from his home in Sri Lanka. ''I'm happy that people are taking it more and more seriously,'' said Mr. Clarke, whose novel ''The Fountains of Paradise'' (1978) revolved around such a space elevator.
The discovery in 1991 of nanotubes, cylindrical molecules of carbon with many times the strength of steel, turned the idea from a fantastical impossibility to an intriguing possibility that could be realized in as little as a decade or two.
Proponents say the economic and technological advantages of a space elevator over rockets make it inevitable. They predict it will lower the cost of putting a satellite into space from $10,000 a pound to $100.
''As soon as we can build it, we should build it,'' said Dr. Bryan E. Laubscher, a scientist at Los Alamos who organized the conference. Just as the transcontinental railroad opened the West in the late 1800's, ''I feel the space elevator is going to be such a paradigm shift in space access,'' Dr. Laubscher said.
Easier economical access to space might also make practical other grandiose projects like solar power satellites that could collect sunlight and beam energy down to Earth.
The conference, a three-day session here, drew 60 people, a mix of scientists and engineers who are working on the concept, space enthusiasts who wanted to hear more and dilettantes from nearby Los Alamos laboratory attracted by curiosity.
''The first thought is, Is this really going to work?'' said Dr. Steven E. Patamia, a researcher at Los Alamos, who was enlisted into performing space elevator calculations a week before the conference. ''When you get into it, it begins to make sense. There are a good number of technical issues. They are probably all 'overcomeable.' ''
The original idea of a space elevator is more than a century old. In 1895, Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky, a Russian visionary who devised workable ideas for rocket propulsion and space travel decades before others, proposed a tower thousands of miles high attached to a ''celestial castle'' in orbit around Earth, with the centrifugal force of the orbiting castle holding up the tower. (Imagine swinging a rope with a rock tied to the end of it.)
But the idea was fundamentally impossible to build. Steel, then the strongest material known, was too heavy and not strong enough to support that weight.
Other scientists periodically revisited and reinvented Tsiolkovsky's idea, inspiring science fiction writers like Mr. Clarke.
Nanotubes spurred NASA to take a more serious look in 1999. A team of scientists envisioned huge cables of nanotubes and magnetically levitated cars traveling up and down. The structure would be so large that it would require grabbing an asteroid and dragging it into Earth orbit to act as the counterweight for holding up the elevator.
To avoid weather, especially lightning, the NASA scientists envisioned the base station as a tower at least 10 miles high.
''We came out of that workshop saying the space elevator is 50 years away,'' said David V. Smitherman of the Marshall Space Flight Center, who led the study.
Around that time, Dr. Bradley C. Edwards, who was then a scientist at Los Alamos, read an even more pessimistic assessment, that a space elevator would not be built for at least 300 years.
''But there was no information why it couldn't be built,'' Dr. Edwards said, and he took that as a challenge. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Imagine you are a team member of the 1999 NASA project envisioning a space elevator. Your task is to write a short essay describing the obstacles and possible obstacles associated with constructing a 60,000-mile high space elevator, specifically focusing on the use of nanotubes and its potential impact on space exploration.

Provide a clear explanation of the technical challenges overcome by the use of nanotubes in the construction of the space elevator.
Discuss the potential risks and consequences of building an elevator of such magnitude, taking into account the factors mentioned in the text, such as weather and the necessity of a counterweight.
Explain how the success of the space elevator project could impact our ability to explore space and the benefits that could result from easier, more affordable access to space.


### ANSWER:
A 60,000-mile high space elevator offer numerous benefits in space exploration however, several obsticles must be overcome. In terms of a material, nanotubes are suitable for construction thanks to their exceptional strength. Technical challenges would include transporting massive amount of nanotubes in to space and merge them correctly in order to get the length required. a second challange is the fixiation of space elevator to ground.","### FEEDBACK: 200 WORDS

#### Introduction:
Your introduction sets the stage for your detailed analysis of the feasibility of building a 60,000-mile high space elevator. It starts by highlighting the significance of the concept, emphasizing the economic and technological advantages of space elevators over traditional rocket launches. By mentioning the early breakthroughs in nanotube technology and the eventual realization of a space elevator, it establishes the urgency of addressing these challenges.

#### Obstacles and Challenges:
The paper details the major hurdles in constructing a space elevator, including the use of nanotubes. These materials are crucial for structural integrity and stability. However, overcoming these challenges requires significant engineering expertise, precise manufacturing techniques, and advanced materials handling systems. Additionally, designing a mechanism to ensure the mass transfer between the nanotubes and the surrounding environment is a complex process requiring rigorous testing and optimization.

Furthermore, the article highlights the importance of a reliable counterweight system to prevent the elevator from tipping over during launch. This system could involve a combination of gravity-based stabilization and aerodynamic lift devices, which are still being developed and tested today. Ensuring the reliability of these components is crucial to maintain the safety and efficiency of the space elevator project.

Another obstacle is the need for a stable foundation to anchor the elevator to the ground. This involves careful design and construction, ensuring that the elevator does not tip over during re-entry or any subsequent maneuvers. The stability of the foundation plays a vital role in maintaining the balance and preventing catastrophic failures.

#### Potential Risks and Consequences:
While the initial phase of the space elevator project appears promising, several risks and consequences must be considered. One of the primary concerns is the risk of environmental damage due to the construction of the elevator. Nanotubes, while highly durable, are not inherently inert and could potentially contaminate the environment if mishandled during transportation or installation. The construction of a space elevator near sensitive ecosystems, such as wildlife habitats, could pose additional challenges.

Another significant risk is the potential for operational disruptions. The rapid deployment of the elevator could lead to unexpected accidents or malfunctions, particularly during launch, re-entry, or orbital maneuvering. This could have far-reaching implications for the entire space industry, disrupting operations and causing delays.

Moreover, the economic impact of the space elevator project cannot be ignored. While the initial investment may seem substantial, the long-term costs and the potential revenue generated from space tourism and commercial services add to the overall financial burden. The lack of public awareness about the technology and its potential applications could further dampen interest in the project.

Additionally, the development of new technologies related to nanotubes and space elevators could face regulatory challenges. Establishing guidelines and certifications for the production and use of these materials would be necessary to ensure they meet the stringent standards required for aerospace applications.

Finally, the geopolitical implications of space exploration are another factor worth considering. If the space elevator becomes a focal point for international competition or military presence, it could strain relationships between nations and pose security threats.

#### Conclusion:
In conclusion, while the initial phase of the space elevator project offers significant promise, several challenges must be addressed to realize its full potential. Overcoming the use of nanotubes and the need for a robust counterweight system present formidable obstacles. Moreover, the economic viability and long-term implications of the project must be carefully evaluated to mitigate potential risks and ensure its successful implementation. As such, the space elevator remains an exciting concept that holds great promise but demands thoughtful planning and regulatory frameworks to navigate its path to fruition."

These finds were part of the ""Attitudes Toward Addiction Survey"" conducted by the Hazelden organization.
The telephone survey of 1,000 adults revealed some lingering stigma associated with alcoholism and drug addiction in spite of the fact 78% of those surveyed agreed that drug addiction is a chronic disease rather than a personal failing.
According to Hazelden, when survey participants were asked to describe people who have problems with drugs or alcohol included: ""sinner,"" ""irresponsible,"" ""selfish, ""stupid,"" ""uncaring,"" ""loser,"" ""undisciplined,"" ""pitiful,"" ""pathetic,"" ""weak,"" ""criminal,"" ""derelict,"" ""washed up"" and ""crazy.""
""What Hazelden's new survey brought home to me is that Americans understand addiction is a disease, yet much more work must be done to explain how effective treatment can be for addicts and to bring an end to the stigma that prevents addicts from pursuing treatment,"" said William Cope Moyers, executive director of Hazelden's Center for Public Advocacy in a news release.
The Prevalence of Addiction
Here are some of the survey findings about the prevalence of addiction:
- Nearly one-third of Americans reported past abuse of alcohol or drugs in their immediate family.
- Of those households with an immediate family member who had an addiction problem, 44% reported more than one family member with a drug problem.
- A third of the families which reported a drug problem in their immediate family say that a majority of their family members have problems with drugs.
- With one in six of the respondents dealing with substance abuse in their family, every member of the family has a problem with drugs or alcohol.
- When asked about extended family, virtually half of Americans surveyed reported three or more family members have experienced a problem with drugs during their lives.
The survey also revealed attitudes about prevention and treatment efforts:
- 79% percent feel the War on Drugs has not been successful.
- 83% agree that much more should be done to prevent addiction.
- 83% believe that first-time drug offenders should get chemical dependency treatment rather than prison time.
- 77 percent agree that many addicts who complete treatment go on to lead useful lives.
- 71% agree health insurance should cover addiction treatment, but most have no idea if their own insurance will pay. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in creating efficient and scalable Objective-C applications. Design patterns have been integral to many of my projects, allowing me to structure code in a way that promotes clean, maintainable, and reusable components. Examples include implementing the Singleton pattern to ensure one instance of a class is created per application, and the Factory Method pattern to encapsulate common functionalities within a class hierarchy.

Thread safety has also been a cornerstone of my development journey. I utilize various synchronization mechanisms, such as `NSAutoreleasePool` for managing thread-safe resource acquisition, and `dispatch_queue` for coordinating multiple operations across different threads efficiently. My understanding of concurrency has enabled me to develop robust and responsive apps that respond quickly to user input and perform complex calculations.

In addition to my technical skills, I possess a deep understanding of design patterns, particularly those related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). By applying these principles, I have designed applications that are not only functional but also visually appealing and easy to understand. This includes the implementation of patterns like the Observer pattern, which allows objects to notify other objects of changes, and the Adapter pattern, which helps in transforming one type of object into another without altering its functionality.

My approach to problem-solving and debugging has been meticulous and systematic, ensuring that every aspect of my work is thoroughly tested and validated. Through the use of logging and breakpoints, I can pinpoint issues promptly and fix them before they become major problems. Additionally, I adhere to the Agile methodology, emphasizing collaboration, communication, and continuous improvement throughout the development process.

Refugee and migrant students entering Australian schools bring with them a range of complex experiences. These may include experiences of trauma, violence or displacement. Some of these young people are entering a formal schooling environment for the first time. Often they are in a classroom where no-one else speaks their language or shares their cultural background.
Supportive and inclusive school settings are important in helping them settle in to Australia and feel at home. School is often one of the first places where refugee and migrant students and their families begin to form connections with their local communities.
In South Australia, refugee and migrant students enter an Intensive English Language Program. These are typically stand-alone classes in mainstream primary schools. Students remain in the program for about 12 months before making the transition to a mainstream class, often at a different school. Refugee children are particularly likely to change school due to things such as insecure housing and changing work settings.
Our research suggests that the South Australian Intensive English Language Program offers a “soft landing” for children. At the same time, the children in our longitudinal study showed anxiety about their English language competency. In particular, they expressed concern that English would be an issue for them as they entered mainstream classes. There was a sense among many children that they would be left behind and thus find it difficult to make friends in their new setting.
Given this anxiety, we found that class topics that don’t require English language skills – such as art and sport - help this diverse group of children to make friends and adjust to mainstream schooling. Both of these factors are important for increasing the well-being of refugee and migrant students.
Students want to share their experiences
Spending time on areas that are not directly related to English language acquisition also allows refugee and migrant children to share their experiences before they came to Australia. We found that creating opportunities for students to share information about themselves not only assisted them in making friends, but also helped them feel a sense of belonging in the school environment.
Many children in our study expressed a strong desire to discuss aspects of their background. This included celebrating cultural and religious festivals, sharing food and language, and talking about the countries in which they had lived. The ability to share their background provided students with a sense of self-esteem and well-being that went beyond that provided by their ability to learn English or immediately “fit in” to their new school environment after transition.
Developing English language skills obviously remains a priority for the education of migrant and refugee children in Australia. However, our research suggests that ensuring the previous experiences of these students are truly heard (rather than just treated as hurdles to English language acquisition) is critically important to their continuing development and school engagement.
We would also note that in a context of standardised education – including NAPLAN testing – it is important to ensure that refugee and migrant students have the opportunity to participate in subjects that allow them to showcase their strengths. Feeling a sense of belonging in the early years of school is vitally important to ensure that students stay engaged with their education. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Imagine you are a teacher in a South Australian mainstream school where a refugee student from your Intensive English Language Program is about to transition into your class.

Write a short, one-page welcome letter to this student, mentioning two class topics or activities that do not require English language skills and explaining how these can help them feel part of the class and build friendships, and include a question that invites them to share a cultural tradition or celebration from their background.


### ANSWER:
Dear [Student], welcome to our mainstream class. We are excited about your transition. Activities like painting and sport dont req English skil and wil make upto friends and ajust to this enviroment. We all did this. Would u share us a cultural tradition or celebration from your background.","### FEEDBACK: 5/5

Vegetables should be part of everyone’s diet. If you don’t want to spend a little bit more for those organically grown and sold in the supermarket, perhaps you should consider planting your own in the garden. It is very easy to do that even your kids can join in the fun.
Organic vegetable gardening is the “in thing” these days as people have realized that the use of fertilizers and pesticides do more harm than good. Yes it will make the vegetables bigger or enable the farmer to harvest them faster but the chemicals used in making this happen could be detrimental to the health of those who eat it.
But since the early farmers never did that and relied only on sunlight and irrigation, this concept is making a comeback. These will also enable you to this at home since you have access to the three most basic things namely soil, water and sunlight.
What kind of organic vegetables can you plant? Well, just about everything. Some examples of these include broccoli, cabbage, carrots, onions, potatoes and a lot more. You just have to know which of them can be planted during the different seasons of the year.
Proper drainage is important for your vegetables. If there isn’t, you can check if it is feasible to grow these using a raise bed.
When you have done your research, you can now buy the seeds from the store. These are usually sold in packets so don’t forget to read the instructions before using them. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Based on the text, assess the advantages of organic vegetable gardening and create a plan for a small home garden, considering factors such as plant selection, proper drainage, and seasonality.

Summarize in 100-150 words the main reasons why organic vegetable gardening is a popular choice today, highlighting the potential risks of fertilizers and pesticides.
Select three vegetables that can be planted easily at home and use online research to identify the best season for planting each one in your geographic location.
Design a basic layout for a home organic garden, including considerations for sunlight, irrigation, and proper drainage (e.g., using raised beds).


### ANSWER:
Organic vegetable gardening is preferred today as it avoids the detrimental health impacts of fertilizers and pesticides, provides an opportunity for family engagement, and relies on natural elements such as sunlight, water, and soil for plant growth. Three easily plantable vegetables at home are broccoli, carrots, and potatoes. Broccoli is typically planted in early spring or late summer/early fall, carrots are planted in early spring or late summer, and potatoes are planted 4-6 weeks before the last frost. A home organic garden layout should ensure proper sunlight and irrigation access, incorporate raised beds for drainage if required, and accommodate seasonal planting of preferred vegetables.","### FEEDBACK:  **Constructive**

**Feedback on Completed Work:**
The student has demonstrated a strong understanding of organic vegetable gardening by selecting appropriate vegetables based on their availability and preferences. They have shown initiative in researching plants suitable for various seasons and locations, which is commendable. However, they need some clarification on how to properly maintain and care for their plants, especially regarding soil preparation and watering needs. Additionally, while the student's knowledge is solid, there might be room for improvement in expressing ideas succinctly when necessary, particularly with complex concepts like fertilization and pesticide usage.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
To enhance clarity and effectiveness in feedback, the following points could be addressed:
1. **Clarify Concepts:** Provide specific examples where the student may struggle to express their thoughts concisely.
2. **Simplify Complex Ideas:** When explaining difficult concepts, break down larger ideas into smaller, manageable parts to avoid overwhelming students.
3. **Use Visual Aids:** Incorporate diagrams or images to illustrate complex processes, ensuring students understand the reasoning behind certain actions.
4. **Provide Examples:** Use real-world scenarios to demonstrate practical applications of learned concepts, reinforcing the relevance of the material.

**Adaptation:**
To accommodate diverse learning styles and levels, the following adaptations could be considered:
1. **Individualized Instruction:** Tailor feedback sessions to individual student needs, addressing any gaps in understanding.
2. **Peer Teaching:** Pairing the student with peers who are struggling with similar topics, allowing for collaborative learning.
3. **Technology Integration:** Utilizing digital tools and platforms that offer interactive feedback and personalized assistance to cater to varying learning abilities.

By implementing these suggestions, the student's understanding and performance in organic vegetable gardening will likely improve significantly."
