07-10-2012 (Dayton, OH) -
A recent outbreak of E. Coli in Germantown, OH has led health officials to remind citizens to take caution when preparing and handling food. This is especially important during outdoor picnics in the high temperatures of the summer months which can intensify the bacteria in the food.
“Human infection of E.Coli is acquired through contaminated food or water or by direct contact with an infected person,” says Terrie Koss, infection preventionist at Dayton Children’s.
Infections due to Escherichia coli bacteria can cause severe, bloody diarrhea. Some cases can result in kidney failure or other serious complications. Fortunately, most healthy kids who get the infection recover on their own without the need for treatment.
“If you suspect your child might have E.Coli you should consult their pediatrician or visit the Dayton Children’s urgent care or emergency department,” says Koss. “The biggest concern is making sure the child stays hydrated.”
The incubation period generally lasts anywhere from 10 hours to six days. An infection is contagious for at least as long as the person has diarrhea, and sometimes longer.
A doctor might take a stool sample to detect the presence of E. coli bacteria. Blood tests may be used to check for possible complications.
Antibiotics have not been found to be helpful in treating infections caused by E. coli O157:H7 and can, in fact, be harmful. Likewise, anti-diarrheal medicines can increase the risk of complications and should not be used.
Kids with an E. coli infection should rest as much as possible and drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. Those who are dehydrated might need to be hospitalized to get IV fluids.
“While recovering from an infection, kids can resume normal activities after two stool cultures are free of the bacteria” says Koss. “Refrain from letting kids use swimming pools or water slides until 2 weeks after their symptoms have gone away.”
E. colioutbreaks have been related to a wide variety of foods, such as fresh spinach, hamburgers, ground beef, bologna, hazelnuts, packaged cheeses, shredded lettuce, and prepackaged cookie dough.
Being vigilant about safe food preparation can go a long way toward protecting your family from E. coli infections:
- Cook meat thoroughly until it reaches a temperature of at least 160ºF/70ºC at its thickest point.
- Thoroughly clean anything that comes into contact with raw meat.
- Choose pasteurized juices and dairy products.
- Clean raw produce well before eating.
Teach your kids the importance of regular, thorough hand washing, especially after going to the bathroom, touching animals, or playing outside, and before eating or preparing food. They should avoid swallowing water while swimming.
When to Call the Doctor
Call your doctor if your child has any symptoms of an E. coli infection, especially stomach pain or persistent, severe, or bloody diarrhea. Call immediately if your child shows signs of dehydration, such as decreased urination.

Imagine you're planning a summer picnic in Germantown, OH, and one of your guests has a weakened immune system. 

Create a list of at least 5 safe food handling and preparation practices you would implement to minimize the risk of an E. coli outbreak. 
Write a clear and concise warning sign that you would post near the food and drinks to remind guests of the importance of proper hygiene.


### ANSWER:
To minimize the risk of an E. coli outbreak, I would implement the following safe food handling practices: 1) Handle raw meat, poultry, and seafood safely by separating them from ready-to-eat foods. 2) Cook food to the correct temperature using a food thermometer. 3) Refrigerate perishable foods promptly and keep them at 40°F (4°C) or below. 4) Use safe water and ice for food preparation and consumption. 5) Keep hot foods hot (145°F / 63°C or above) and cold foods cold (40°F / 4°C or below). I would post the following warning sign: Warning: Help Prevent the Spread of E. coli! Please wash your hands frequently with soap and water, especially after using the restroom and before eating. Avoid cross-contamination by separating raw and ready-to-eat foods. ","### FEEDBACK:  Your response demonstrates a good understanding of safe food handling practices to minimize the risk of an E. coli outbreak. However, there are a couple of areas for improvement.

You correctly identified the importance of proper handwashing and separating raw and ready-to-eat foods. However, you could have also mentioned the importance of proper food storage and disposal to prevent cross-contamination.
Your warning sign is clear and concise, but it could be more effective if it included specific examples of safe food handling practices, such as 'Use pasteurized juices and dairy products' or 'Refrigerate perishable foods promptly and keep them at 40°F (4°C) or below'."

Ecosystem Exploration

Imagine you are a biologist visiting Petrified Forest National Park. Using iNaturalist.org as a reference, describe 3 unique species that can be found in the park's short-grass prairie environment, and explain how these species adapt to the semi-arid grassland's conditions. Be sure to provide the name of the species, its classification, and a brief description of its adaptive features.


### ANSWER:
1. The Western Meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta) is a bird species, classified as a member of the Icteridae family. It has a distinctive song and a brown back with a black V-shaped mark. Its adaptation is its unique nesting behavior - the female builds a nest in dense vegetation to conceal it from predators and harsh weather. 2. The Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) is a native North American species, classified as a member of the Antilocapridae family. It is well adapted to the semi-arid environment with its ability to survive without water for extended periods by metabolizing the moisture from the plants it eats. 3. The Narrow-leaved Yucca (Yucca angustissima) is an evergreen plant species, classified as a member of the Asparagaceae family. It is adaptable to dry conditions due to its thick waxy leaves that help to conserve water by reducing moisture loss through transpiration.","### FEEDBACK:  Your response demonstrates a good understanding of the unique species found in Petrified Forest National Park's short-grass prairie environment. However, there are a few areas for improvement.

To strengthen your answer, consider providing more specific details about the park's semi-arid grassland conditions, such as the types of vegetation and climate factors that support these species. This will help to create a more comprehensive and accurate description of the ecosystem.
Additionally, be sure to include the classification of the species (e.g., kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species) to provide a more complete and scientifically accurate description of the species."

An ancient Roman lead scroll unearthed in England three years ago has turned out to be a curse intended to cause misfortune to more than a dozen people, according to new research.
Found in East Farleigh, U.K., in the filling of a 3rd to 4th Century AD building that may have originally been a temple, the scroll was made of a 2.3- by 3.9-inch inscribed lead tablet.
Popular in the Greek and Roman world, these sorts of ""black magic"" curses called upon gods to torment specific victims.
Rolled up to conceal their inscriptions, the tablets were either nailed to the wall of a temple or buried in places considered to be close to the underworld, such as graves, springs or wells.
The scroll, unearthed in the Kent village had been carefully rolled up and buried, most likely in the third century AD, similar to other curse tablets found throughout Europe.
The researchers tried to read the fragile scroll without unrolling it by using a technique called neutron computed tomography imaging at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, but ""the resolution was not sufficient to discern any writing on it,"" said the Maidstone Area Archaeological Group, which made the finding.
As the curse tablet, or defixio, was unrolled, the inscribed letters became visible under a scanning electron microscope.
Roger Tomlin, lecturer in late Roman history at Wolfson College, Oxford, and an authority on Roman inscriptions, was finally able to decode the inscribed text.
""The tablet is not necessarily complete, but what there is consists of two columns of personal names,"" Tomlin told Discovery News.
He deciphered the Latin names Sacratus, Constitutus, Memorianus, Constant[...] and the Celtic names (Atr)ectus and Atidenus. Eight other names are incomplete.
Interestingly, the scribe wrote a few of the names backward or upside down.
Experts speculated that this was probably intended to invoke ""sympathetic magic"" and make life especially difficult for the named and shamed individuals.
However, the motive of the curse and the curse itself remain a mystery.
""No god is named. Indeed, we cannot be sure that we have the beginning of the text,"" Tomlin said.
Overall, more than 200 curse tablets have been found in Britain. The largest collection was found in the thermal spring at Bath, -- about 100 tablets -- and are displayed in the Roman Baths Museum.
The second-largest collection is from the Roman temple at Uley, and some are displayed in the British Museum.
Most curses related to thefts and called upon a god to fulfill the malevolent wishes detailed in the inscriptions.
One of the tablets from Bath, for example, prayed that its victim should ""become as liquid as water,"" while another on display at the British Museum cursed ""Tretia Maria and her life and mind and memory and liver and lungs mixed up together, and her words, thoughts and memory.""
According to the Maidstone Area archaeologists, it is reasonable to assume that the names listed were of people who lived at the site.
""Since the Romans were the first inhabitants of England who could read and write, they represent the earliest inhabitants of East Farleigh that we may ever be able to put a name to,"" they said.
Further conservation work will be carried out on the scroll starting at the end of the month. Experts hope that this will result in more letters becoming visible.
This story was provided by Discovery News. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Ancient Curse Unveiled

Imagine you are an archaeologist who has just discovered the unrolled curse tablet in the Kent village. Write a journal entry (approx. 150-200 words) describing the emotions and thoughts you experienced upon seeing the inscribed names and realizing the purpose of the ancient artifact.


### ANSWER:
Today was a day I will not soon forget. As I unrolled the ancient curse tablet, I felt a mix of excitement and trepidation. The faded inscriptions on the lead surface slowly revealed the names of those who were intended to be tormented by the curse. I couldn't help but feel a sense of reverence for the people who lived in this village centuries ago, as well as a sense of unease knowing that these names represented real individuals who were the target of someone's malice. The names Sacratus, Constitutus, Memorianus, and others seemed to jump off the surface, transporting me to a time and place where such curses were not only plausible but also a reality. I couldn't help but wonder about the stories behind each name and the circumstances that led someone to seek such vengeful measures. It was a sobering reminder that, despite the passing of time, human nature remains a constant. The tablet serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities and mysteries of human history.","### FEEDBACK:  Your journal entry effectively conveys the emotions and thoughts you experienced upon discovering the curse tablet. You successfully captured the sense of reverence and unease that comes with uncovering a piece of history that was once shrouded in secrecy.

To improve the clarity of your writing, consider varying your sentence structure and length. Some of your sentences are quite long and convoluted, which can make them difficult to follow. Try breaking them up into shorter, simpler sentences that convey the same information.
While your journal entry is engaging, it could benefit from more specific details about the discovery process. For example, you could describe the conditions under which you found the tablet, the process of unrolling it, and any other relevant details that might help bring the experience to life."

33. Difference between Lenses and Filters
May 13, 2015
Lenses and Filters are investigative tools of enquiry and domain analysis allowing the discovery of concepts and relations. The difference between (BIM) Lenses and Filters can be summarised as such: Lenses are additive and are deployed from the ‘investigator’s side’ of BIM Field observation while Filters are subtractive and are deployed from the ‘data side’. Lenses highlight observables that meet research criteria and identify their relations; example, an infrared lens highlights heat sources in a scene. Filters remove observables that do not meet the research criteria; example, data filters hides non-conforming data within a spreadsheet. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
In a research project employing Building Information Modelling (BIM) to analyze energy efficiency in buildings, you need to identify areas with high heat loss.

Explain how you would utilize a Lens and a Filter in your BIM analysis to achieve your research goal, providing a specific example for each tool and highlighting their distinct outputs.


### ANSWER:
To identify areas with high heat loss, I would utilize a Lens to highlight areas with high heat loss by deploying a thermal lens that visualizes temperature differences across the building structure, for example, it could reveal areas around windows or doors where heat is escaping. On the other hand, I would use a Filter to remove data that is not relevant to heat loss, such as data on room usage or lighting, thereby isolating the specific data on heat loss and facilitating my analysis.","### FEEDBACK:  Your explanation of utilizing a Lens and a Filter in BIM analysis to identify areas with high heat loss is clear and concise.

You correctly identified the distinct outputs of a Lens and a Filter, but consider providing more specific details on how you would deploy and configure these tools in your analysis.
To further enhance your explanation, consider discussing potential challenges or limitations of using Lenses and Filters in your analysis, such as data accuracy or interpretation."

The Lead in a Song Bird
There are dangers for people who work with lead. There are also dangers for birds who live near lead. About half of ground-feeding songbirds collected from a historic lead mining district in southeast Missouri contained toxic levels of lead in their blood and internal organs, according to a new U.S. Geological Survey study. Elevated lead levels were also found in soils and earthworms in the lead district sites examined, which included the ""Missouri Mines""in the Old Lead Belt; ""Washington State Park,"" on the Big River floodplain; and the ""Viburnum Trend,"" within Mark Twain National Forest. Tested birds had lead concentrations exceeding those of reference birds by factors of 8 in blood, 13 in liver, and 23 in kidney samples. Soils in the study exceeded background levels for lead nearly 40 fold, for zinc 8 fold, and for cadmium 25 fold.
Southeast Missouri contains the world's largest deposit of the lead mineral galena. The area has a long history of lead mining and smelting. Lead has been mined in the region since 1721. Previous studies have measured elevated lead in floodplain soils, stream sediments, fish, invertebrates, amphibians, other birds and wildlife in the area. Lead has been released from the erosion of tailings, mine waste, smelting, and dust. Periodic flooding has also transported lead in the environment.
The Southeast Missouri Lead District, commonly called the Lead Belt, is a lead mining district in the southeastern part of Missouri. Counties in the Lead Belt include Saint Francois; Crawford; Dent; Iron; Madison: Reynolds; and Washington. The town of Sainte Genevieve was founded as a river port for transportation of lead out of the area. Moses Austin started large-scale mining and smelting, at Potosi, originally known as Mine a Breton, and founded Herculaneum as his shipping point on the Mississippi. This lead was originally used as a roofing material. Bonne Terre has large subterranean mines, now used commercially for recreational scuba diving.
The area of mining has changed over the years. The Old Lead Belt is centered around Park Hills and Desloge, while the New Lead Belt or Viburnum Trend is near Viburnum. The Irish Wilderness in Ripley and Oregon Counties has significant lead ore; however, this is a protected wilderness area.
Cadmium levels in birds from the mining study sites were also several times those in reference birds, but concentrations of zinc were not elevated more than those in the reference birds.
Ground-feeding songbirds were selected for the study because they were more likely to be exposed to lead than songbirds feeding in shrubs or in the forest canopy. Cardinals, robins, blue jays, and eastern towhees were among the birds tested.
USGS completed this study at the request of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service as part of a natural resource damage assessment by the U.S. Department of the Interior to investigate whether wildlife might be adversely affected by exposure to lead contaminated soil.
Lead poisoning in birds can cause abnormal muscular function, kidney and liver failure, decreased fertility, and anemia. Songbirds poisoned by lead, however, generally do not show lesions. The exposure to lead is detected by chemically testing tissues or by measuring suppressed enzyme levels.
Lead is a highly poisonous metal (regardless if inhaled or swallowed), affecting almost every organ and system in the body. The main target for lead toxicity is the nervous system, both in adults and children.
The study, ""Toxic exposure of songbirds to lead in the Southeast Missouri Lead Mining District,"" is available in the journal Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology.

Galena image via Wikipedia. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Analyze the impact of lead exposure on ground-feeding songbirds in the Southeast Missouri Lead District, focusing on the causal relationships between environmental lead concentrations and toxicity in the birds’ biological systems.

Explain the mechanisms of lead exposure in ground-feeding songbirds, highlighting the role of contaminated soils, earthworms, and floodplain dynamics.
Discuss the ecological implications of lead toxicity in songbirds, including population-level effects, behavioral changes, and potential cascading effects on ecosystem health.


### ANSWER:
Lead exposure in ground-feeding songbirds in the Southeast Missouri Lead District is primarily caused by the ingestion of contaminated soils and earthworms. The region’s history of lead mining and smelting has resulted in elevated lead levels in the environment, which are transported through floodplain dynamics and affect the birds’ biological systems.","### FEEDBACK:  Your analysis provides a good starting point for understanding the impact of lead exposure on ground-feeding songbirds in the Southeast Missouri Lead District.

To strengthen your argument, consider incorporating specific data from the study, such as the concentrations of lead in the birds' blood, liver, and kidney samples, to illustrate the causal relationships between environmental lead concentrations and toxicity in the birds' biological systems.
To further develop your analysis, explore the potential cascading effects of lead toxicity on ecosystem health, including the impact on other species that may be affected by the same environmental factors, and discuss the implications for conservation and management efforts in the region."

Monovision is a method of treatment used for patients who have developed a condition called presbyopia. Presbyopia usually starts to develop when people reach the age of 40-45. It causes uncontrollable change to eyesight and usually results in problems with reading and focusing on objects that are close by. Most cases of presbyopia can be aided with glasses and contact lenses; however, a method called monovision may also be helpful. Monovision involves fitting one eye with a distance lens and one eye with a close-up lens, which enables people to see clearly at distance and up-close.
Presbyopia is a condition which affects the ability of the eyes to switch between focusing on far and near objects, therefore making it difficult to see objects close-up. Presbyopia usually develops around the age of 40 and eventually everyone will develop the condition. Presbyopia is sometimes known as ‘short-arm syndrome’ and the main symptom is difficulty focusing on things that are close to you, which means you may have difficulty reading small print on a computer screen, in a book or on a medicine bottle, for example.
How does monovision work?
Monovision may seem like an odd concept, but it can be very effective. Monovision works by essentially tricking the eye into thinking that the contact lens is part of the natural eye. Each one of us has a dominant and non-dominant eye. A contact lens for distance viewing is placed in the dominant eye and a contact lens for near viewing is placed in the non-dominant eye.
It is also possible to have monovision laser treatment (a method called monovision LASIK), which uses the same concept but there is no need for contact lenses. One eye is corrected for distance viewing and one eye is corrected for nearby viewing. For those who are not sure whether they want to commit to surgery, it is advisable to try monovision with contact lenses first and see how you get on. Before you have surgery you will be examined by an ophthalmologist to check that monovision is a suitable treatment for you. The risks of the procedure, which tend to be very low, will also be explained.
Adjusting to monovision
It can take a short while to become accustomed to Monovision, but after a while most people are unaware that they are wearing different types of contact lenses and they experience a significant improvement in their sight.
Monovision is not a suitable treatment for everyone, though it does appear to be effective for many people with presbyopia. Monovision will not give you perfect vision, but it can help to make your vision considerably better. There may be a slight loss of focus between distance and close viewing, so monovision may not be suitable for patients who require optimum levels of correction. Your optometrist or ophthalmologist will be able to tell you whether you are a suitable candidate for monovision treatment. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Design a public service announcement poster for people aged 40+ about the effects of presbyopia, including the possibility of monovision treatment.

Create eye-catching visuals illustrating how presbyopia affects daily life, such as reading or using a computer.
Write a clear and concise paragraph explaining presbyopia and the concept of monovision treatment.
Include a call-to-action, urging viewers to consult an ophthalmologist for advice on treatment options.


### ANSWER:
{'poster_title': '40+ and Struggling to See Up-Close?', 'visuals': 'A split-screen image of a person struggling to read a book vs. Easily reading with glasses.', 'description': ""Presbyopia affects most people over 40, causing eye strain and blurred vision when focusing on near objects. Monovision treatment can help, with one eye corrected for distance and one eye for near vision. Ask your ophthalmologist if it's right for you."", 'call_to_action': 'Consult an eye care professional today!'}","### FEEDBACK:  Your poster design effectively conveys the main message about presbyopia and monovision treatment.

Consider adding a subtitle or tagline to the poster title to make it more attention-grabbing and informative.
To make the visuals more impactful, you could add a brief description or caption explaining the split-screen image, such as 'Before and After: Presbyopia Treatment Options' or 'How Monovision Works'.
In the description paragraph, you could provide more specific details about the monovision treatment process, such as 'A simple procedure that involves reshaping the cornea to correct nearsightedness or farsightedness' or 'A minimally invasive surgery that uses a femtosecond laser to create a thin flap in the cornea'."

"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
All organisms contain protein but the protein content of organisms varies. In general, foods of animal origin have a greater protein content than plants and plant-derived foods. This is largely due to the skeletal muscle of animals or protein requirements before (e.g., egg) or after birth (e.g., milk). The protein content of skeletal muscle or animal flesh is approximately 22%. Water-packed tuna derives more than 80% of its energy from protein. Approximately 65% of the protein that Americans eat is derived from animal sources. In comparison, many African and Asian societies derive only about 20% of their protein from animals.
Below is a general overview of different types of proteins and their protein content based on portion size:
Animal meat proteins are very similar to human skeletal muscle proteins and include myosin, actin, troponins, and other proteins. Typically, animal meat is more than 80% protein on a dry weight basis. In addition to protein, meats deliver iron, selenium, and vitamin B12. Meats are among the best food sources of creatine, carnosine, and beta-alanine. However, meats are often a contributor of fat to the diet. Chicken tends to store more fat beneath the skin (subcutaneously) whereas cows have adipose tissue marbled throughout their muscle tissue, which is visually obvious. Removing the skin of a chicken breast or thigh would greatly lower the fat content and increase the protein content (as a percent of total energy). Beef can be trimmed of visible fat to lower its fat content. However, fat in food provides flavoring.
Fish proteins are very similar to mammalian meat proteins with a few striking differences. For instance, microscopically, the striated appearance of fish myo- fibrils is similar to mammals and contains the same proteins. However the skeletal muscle of fish is organized with shorter fibers and arranged between connective tissue sheets. Fish is generally a lean protein source containing relatively little fat. For instance, water-packed tuna derives more than 80% of its energy from protein. While being a leaner protein option is true for many fish, consumers need to check the food label, as some fish are fatty or perhaps canned in oils which can increase the non-protein calories of a fish source.
Milk proteins include casein and serum proteins or whey. Casein proteins account for roughly 78% of milk’s nitrogen-based mass and whey is 17%. The remaining nitrogen compounds found in milk are mostly amino acids and peptides. Casein is a family of spherical phosphoproteins while whey consists largely of b-lactoglobulin, lactalbumin, immunoglobulins, and other albumins. The most abundant whey protein is b-lactoglobulin, which is rich in the amino acids lysine, leucine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid while the immunoglobulins are largely immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA, and IgG. Whey and casein proteins are among the most common proteins in protein supplements with sourcing as whey protein concentrate (WPC; 80% protein dry weight) and whey protein isolate (WPI; 90% protein dry weight). Whey tends to be digested and absorbed faster than other proteins, including slower digesting casein proteins. The main difference is that whey is more acid stable than casein, which results in whey moving from the stomach to the small intestine quickly while casein forms a gel and slows the transit time dramatically.
There are at least eight main proteins in egg whites, including ovalbumin, conalbumin, ovomucoid, avidin, flavoprotein-apoprotein, “proteinase inhibitor,” ovomucin, and globulins. Protein collectively accounts for about 11–12% of liquid egg white. Meanwhile, much of the egg yolk proteins are found in the form of emulsifying lipoproteins due to the high lipid content of the yolk. Egg yolk is rich in fat and consequently egg white has higher protein concentration (gram for gram) than a whole egg or the yolk. To highlight the difference, a whole egg will have 6 g protein (24 kcals) and about 75 kcals total, so a whole egg is roughly 33% protein while at the same time, one egg white will have 3–4 grams of protein, which accounts for > 90% of its 15–16 kcals.
The four main protein fractions in wheat are albumin, globulin, gliadin, and glutenin. When gliadin and glutenin, as part of flour, are mixed with water, they form gluten, which provides the structural network that allows bread to rise. Gluten proteins are rich in glutamine and relatively low in lysine, methionine, and tryptophan. Gluten-free products have appeared on the market in high amounts during the last decade. Some individuals have a sensitivity and/or allergic reaction to gluten in the intestine that results in diarrhea and malabsorption issues (gluten-sensitive enteropathy). Whether gluten is responsible for other health conditions is debatable and controversial.
Soy proteins are complex multiprotein globulins in general and soy protein is a good source of all essential amino acids except methionine and tryptophan. Soy protein isolate (SPI) is used commercially in drinks mixed with fruit and water, coffee whiteners, liquid whipped toppings, and sour cream dressings. Soy proteins are often found associated with isoflavone molecules, such as genestein and daidzein, which might have health-promoting properties and are considered nutraceuticals (Soy protein isolate is used in some protein supplements and is a more cost effective protein ingredient than WPI.
Approximate Protein Content of Various Foods
|Food name||Weight (g)||Protein (g)|
|Cod, poached||3.2 oz||21|
|Cheddar Cheese||1 oz||7|
|Peanut butter||2 tbsp||8|
|Carrots, sliced||2 cups||1| \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Critically evaluate the differences between protein sources from animal and plant origins, specifically discussing a food from each category that has been highlighted in the provided text as a significant source of protein, including protein content, essential amino acids, and potential drawbacks to consumption.

Choose one example of a protein-rich food from an animal source (e.g. egg, milk, meat) and one example from a plant-based source (e.g. soy, wheat), ensuring both are explicitly mentioned in the text, to form the basis of your comparison.
Your response should clearly outline the protein content of each food, its essential amino acid profile, and discuss its potential limitations or health considerations for human consumption, all within a 300-word limit.
Your answer will be evaluated on the basis of the depth of your analysis, accuracy of the information provided, and overall coherence of your argument.


### ANSWER:
This critical evaluation will focus on whey protein, an animal-derived protein source, and soy protein, a plant-based protein source. Whey protein, found in milk, is a fast-digesting protein with a high protein content of 90% in its isolate form (WPI). It contains all essential amino acids, with a high concentration of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), including leucine, isoleucine, and valine. However, whey protein has been associated with potential digestive issues, such as bloating and gas, in some individuals. On the other hand, soy protein is a plant-based protein source that is a good source of all essential amino acids, except for methionine and tryptophan. Soy protein isolate (SPI) has a protein content of approximately 90% and is often used in food products and protein supplements. However, soy protein has been linked to potential thyroid problems due to its isoflavone content. Additionally, soy protein has been criticized for its potential environmental impact, as large-scale soybean farming has been linked to deforestation and habitat destruction.","### FEEDBACK:  Your critical evaluation provides a good comparison between whey protein and soy protein, highlighting their protein content, essential amino acid profiles, and potential drawbacks to consumption.

To strengthen your analysis, consider providing more specific examples of how whey protein and soy protein are used in food products, such as protein powders, energy bars, or breakfast cereals. This will help to illustrate the practical applications of these protein sources.
When discussing the potential environmental impact of soy protein production, try to provide more concrete evidence, such as citing specific studies or reports that have investigated the environmental effects of large-scale soybean farming. This will help to add depth and credibility to your analysis."

CORE COMPETENCIES AND DOMAINS OF LEARNING
The knowledge base of the Vocational Rehabilitation profession is divided into a number of domains which reflect major areas of knowledge. These domains were constructed by examining the field and other similar professional designations (e.g., CCRC, CDMP, RRP, etc.).
1. Vocational Rehabilitation Theory and Practice:
This is a fairly large and complex domain in that it contains the foundational information of the profession. It includes such topics as: history of vocational rehabilitation profession, models of vocational rehabilitation, the value of vocational rehabilitation (e.g., why do it), legal foundation, other professions which provide services to vocational rehabilitation professionals, legal implications (e.g., expert witness), etc.
2. Aspects of Disabilities:
The VR professional needs to have a clear understanding of the wide range of disabilities and their implications: work related injuries / illness, non-work related injuries / illnesses, congenital disabilities, physical disabilities, psychological disabilities, preventative approaches, trends in disabilities (e.g.. rise of psychological disabilities), etc.
3. Vocational Interviewing and Counselling:
Typically, this is the first step in the VR process and every professional should have skills in these areas. This domain examines the techniques and implications of vocational interviewing: what information is important, how is trust built, what should be documented, how to elicit information, etc. The professional also needs a solid understanding of vocational counselling techniques including: understanding the end-goal, understanding the client needs / goals, working with the difficult client, moving the client forward, cross-cultural / gender implications, development of return to work plan, etc.
Not all VR professionals will undertake assessments of clients but everyone needs to have a clear understanding of their uses and implications. There should be an understanding of: when assessments are used, the types of assessments which can be used (e.g., aptitude, interest, achievement), what the various assessments test, how to read and understand an assessment, defining the questions to be asked of the assessor, transferable skills analysis, using computer software programs, statistics (e.g., standard deviation, mean, median, mode, etc.), etc.
One of the major directions within all professions over the past number of years is the understanding of the diversity of clients. This domain examines the various diverse groups (e.g., gender, cultural, racial, sexual orientation, etc.) and the implications for the VR process. VR professionals should understand: how to identify one’s own biases, working with diverse groups, using community / family resources, understanding the implications of diversity on return to work, etc.
6. Job Development and Placement:
Getting individuals with disability characteristics into or back into the workforce is one of the main tenets of the VR profession and this domain is at the heart of what many professionals undertake on an ongoing basis. This domain examines: understanding limitations / restrictions, understanding job demands, hidden job market, resume construction, interview skills, locating a job placement, job club, job coaching, co-worker model, monitoring, job development, etc.
7. Case / Disability Management:
This domain covers two fairly broad areas: case management and disability management. In Case Management, professionals need to have an understanding of: working with the medical community, working with insurance carriers (including the compensation system), using community resources, referrals to additional resources, the rehabilitation process, rehabilitation professionals, etc. Disability Management covers such areas as: early contact, early intervention, working with management / labour groups, job accommodation, job modification, work related restrictions / limitations, graduated return to work, etc
8. Ethical and Professional Conduct:
This domain examines the ethical foundation for professionals’ work. This would include: determining ethical dilemmas, understanding conflicting values, examining possible decisions and their short / long term implications, codes of ethics, legal responsibilities, etc. In addition, this domain covers the VR professional’s well-being (e.g., burn out, relaxation, healthy life-style, etc.)
9. Communication and Record Keeping:
This domain examines: keeping accurate records, what should / should not be documented, communication with other professionals, file and document security, speaking to a group, use of computer programs (such as word processor, PowerPoint, Excel), adult learning, release of information, etc.

### ANSWER:
One scenario that comes to mind involves a client named Sarah, who has been out of work for several months due to a spinal cord injury. Sarah is eager to return to work and has expressed interest in a career as a graphic designer. To assist Sarah in achieving her goal, I would draw from the following three domains: Vocational Interviewing and Counselling, Job Development and Placement, and Communication and Record Keeping.","### FEEDBACK:  Your scenario effectively demonstrates how you would draw from multiple domains to assist a client in achieving their goal of returning to work.

To strengthen your scenario, consider providing more specific details about the skills you would use from each domain. For example, you could explain how you would use your knowledge of vocational interviewing to help Sarah identify her strengths and weaknesses as a graphic designer, or how you would use your skills in job development to help Sarah locate job openings that match her skills and interests.
Additionally, think about how you would adapt your approach to meet the unique needs and circumstances of your client. For instance, you could consider how you would modify your communication style to accommodate Sarah's physical limitations, or how you would use technology to facilitate communication and record-keeping."

It’s one of those thoughts that hit you as you’re showering in the morning: why exactly do we use glass for windows? Why not plastic or some other material?
It’s a pretty interesting idea. Glass is something we associate as being very fragile. Windows are supposed to offer some degree of protection, but fragile and safety don’t exactly go hand-in-hand. Plus, in an earthquake or a storm, shattered glass could injure or even kill someone. It certainly wouldn’t be hard to cut yourself with it. Glass is also difficult to transport, as it can easily crack while it’s moving from factory to destination.
So why do we, a society that is always looking for the best and the most convenient, still use something as impractical as glass?
There are a couple of interesting reasons. First of all, even though glass can shatter, it’s stronger than you think. Plus, there really is no in-between for glass: it’s either in good condition or it’s broken. Sure, it can get slightly damaged or cracked but that is more of an inconvenience than a serious issue, and it’s very easy to spot. A material like plastic could easily get warped or wear down and you would have no idea. It could be potentially useless, and since there’s no way of you knowing, you wouldn’t know to replace it.
Another reason is because glass is a very hard material. Plastic and other materials just simply can’t compare to it. It’s not hard to scratch plastic. Glass, on the other hand, holds up against dirt, sand, and other material that gets thrown at it. Sure, if you threw a baseball directly at it, the glass will shatter whereas the plastic would be okay. But if there was a storm and the wind was kicking up small rocks or other material, the glass would probably come out untouched whereas the plastic would have noticeable wear.
Glass is also sturdy while still being thin. If you tried to make a thin piece of plastic and stand it up, it will probably fold over. Glass, on the other hand, doesn’t bend at all. It’s a solid material that remains stiff and sturdy. A plastic window would need to be significantly thicker to make it that stiff, and that thickness would affect the overall quality of the window and probably not look as good.
An important part of having windows is that it helps you with your energy conservation. If you don’t know how windows affect your energy bills, check out some of our other posts about the importance of having energy efficient windows. Basically, windows are essential for insulation, especially double-paned windows. Plastic doesn’t exactly have the same insulating properties and would therefore not work as well.
Finally, the ability of glass to break can actually be a good thing. If you were stuck in a house during a fire and needed to get out, it would be really tough to break a plastic window. But, all it would take is a chair or a heavy object to shatter the glass window allowing you to get out.
So, as you can see, it’s perfectly reasonable and even preferable for us to use glass for our windows. However, not all glass is the same. Arch City Window chooses to use ultra-high quality glass so that you get the optimum comfort and function. Our low-e glass uses a transparent coating that drastically increases your efficiency. If you’re interested in getting new windows or want more information about just how good our glass is, head over to archcitywindow.com! \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Analyze and compare the structural and functional properties of three different materials (glass, acrylic, and polycarbonate) for window applications.

Consider the thermal insulation and optical clarity of the three materials.
Examine and compare the durability, scratch resistance, and maintenance needs of the three materials.
think of potential alternatives for the three given materials, considering any specialty window applications, like specialty glass, high-security windows and windows for extreme weather conditions.


### ANSWER:
For window applications, glass, acrylic, and polycarbonate have different structural and functional properties. Thermal insulation and optical clarity are crucial factors. Glass has high optical clarity, but its thermal insulation varies depending on the type. Acrylic has lower optical clarity and variable thermal insulation, while polycarbonate has lower optical clarity and higher thermal insulation than glass. Durability-wise, glass is prone to shattering, but has high scratch resistance and low maintenance needs. Acrylic is less prone to shattering than glass, but more prone than polycarbonate. However, acrylic has lower scratch resistance than glass and higher maintenance needs. Polycarbonate is highly resistant to shattering, but has lower scratch resistance and higher maintenance needs than glass. For specialty window applications, aluminum oxynitrides, thin film ceramic, and polymer-coated glass are notable alternatives. Also considering high-security windows, laminated glass and metal-reinforced polymers could be used. For extreme weather conditions, weather-resistant acrylic and high-impact polycarbonate are potential alternatives.","### FEEDBACK:  Your analysis of the structural and functional properties of glass, acrylic, and polycarbonate for window applications is thorough, but there are a few areas that need improvement.

You correctly identified the thermal insulation and optical clarity of the three materials, but failed to consider the impact of frame material on overall window performance. For example, you could have discussed how the frame material affects the overall energy efficiency of the window.
Your comparison of durability, scratch resistance, and maintenance needs is mostly accurate, but you could have provided more specific examples to support your claims. For instance, you could have mentioned the specific types of glass or acrylic that are more prone to shattering or scratches.
Your discussion of specialty window applications is a good start, but you could have provided more specific examples of alternative materials and their applications. For example, you could have discussed the use of aluminum oxynitrides in high-security windows or the use of polymer-coated glass in specialty glass applications."

COVID-19 exacerbated preexisting resentment against racial/ethnic minorities and marginalized communities, according to a government study conducted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the nation’s medical research agency. Furthermore, the taxpayer-funded probe reveals that in comparison with whites all minorities “were more likely to report that people acted afraid of them because of suspected COVID-19 infection.” Limited English proficiency, less than a high school education and an annual income below $60,000 were also associated with experiencing increased discrimination, the study found.
Scientists from the NIH’s National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities used a special tool called Unequal Racial Burden (CURB) survey to conduct the analysis. The data was used to measure the prevalence of COVID-19-related discrimination in all major racial and ethnic groups in the United States. The government scientists also analyzed the impact of other social and demographic factors on pandemic-related discrimination and found that people from marginalized groups, such as those who speak little to no English and those with lower education levels, were also found to face more discrimination. “To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest, most racially diverse, and most recent assessment of COVID-19–related discrimination in the United States,” the researchers write in their recently published paper.
Information was collected by the online CURB survey in English and Spanish from 5,500 American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Black/African American, Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, Latino, white, and multiracial adults. The survey asked whether participants had experienced COVID-19–related discriminatory behaviors, such as being called names or insulted, being threatened or harassed, or hearing racist comments, because the perpetrator thought the participant had COVID-19. The survey also asked whether participants felt that others acted afraid of them because they belonged to a racial/ethnic group misconceived to get COVID-19 more often.
More than 42% of the minority responders reported that “people acted afraid of them,” and 22% said they had experienced “COVD-19-related discriminatory behaviors.” All racial and ethnic minority groups are more likely to experience COVID-related discrimination compared to whites, the racial burden surveys reveal. “Participants who identified as Asian or American Indian/Alaska Native were most likely to have experienced this hostile behavior, and participants who identified as Hawaiian or Pacific Islander or Latino were also highly likely to have experienced discrimination,” the findings state. “Higher rates of discrimination affected participants who lived in a big city; in a rural area; or in Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, or Tennessee.”
In an announcement promoting the study last week the NIH writes that the results suggest COVID-19 has worsened existing resentment toward racial and ethnic minorities and “other minority populations” in the United States. “The study showcases the need for careful and responsible public health messaging during public health crises to help prevent and address discrimination against groups that have been marginalized,” the agency writes. In the paper the researchers state that “efforts are needed to minimize and discredit racially driven language and discrimination around COVID-19 and future epidemics.” They also assert that future studies and public health efforts focused on COVID-related discrimination “should explicitly include all major racial/ethnic groups, as most appear to be at equally high risk as Asian adults but have thus far been largely ignored in antidiscrimination efforts.”
The government scientists seem to indicate that the problem is probably much worse than the study reveals because there were limitations. For example, the survey was administered online and minorities with limited or no internet access were less likely to be included. Another limitation, conveniently buried at the bottom of the NIH press release, is that it was a “self-reported survey, and discrimination was based on perceived motivations of the perpetrators.” \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Case Study: COVID-19's Impact on Marginalized Communities

Analyze the data from the NIH's CURB survey and propose strategies to address the issue of COVID-19-related discrimination in the US. Write a 3-page policy brief focusing on the following aspects: (1) the impact of existing social and economic inequalities on COVID-19-related discrimination, (2) the limitations of the CURB survey and potential biases in the data, and (3) effective public health messaging and policy interventions to mitigate the effects of COVID-19-related discrimination on marginalized communities.


### ANSWER:
Policy Brief: Addressing COVID-19-Related Discrimination in Marginalized Communities","### FEEDBACK:  Policy Brief: Addressing COVID-19-Related Discrimination in Marginalized Communities

The policy brief provides a comprehensive analysis of the issue of COVID-19-related discrimination in marginalized communities, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to address the root causes of this problem.

To strengthen the policy brief, consider incorporating more specific data and statistics from the NIH's CURB survey, such as the prevalence of COVID-19-related discrimination among different racial and ethnic groups, to support the proposed strategies.
Additionally, consider providing more detailed examples of effective public health messaging and policy interventions, such as culturally sensitive education campaigns or community-based programs, to mitigate the effects of COVID-19-related discrimination on marginalized communities."

Statement of Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., Director, NIAID, NIH, on National HIV Testing Day, June 27, 2010
June 25, 2010
Routine HIV testing is central to ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In the United States, someone becomes infected with HIV every nine and a half minutes. More than 20 percent of the estimated 1.1 million Americans living with HIV infection do not know they are infected.
On National HIV Testing Day, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, urges everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 years to be tested for HIV at least once in their lifetime in keeping with the recommendation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). People at high risk for HIV infection -- including substance abusers and their sexual partners, gay and bisexual men, female partners of bisexual men, and individuals with multiple sex partners -- should get tested at least once a year.
Knowing one's HIV status is vitally important to the individual and for protecting the broader public health. Testing positive for HIV infection is the critical first step linking a person to counseling, medical care and treatment, which help improve quality of health and stave off HIV-related complications and co-infections. People who know they are infected with HIV also are more likely to reduce behaviors that could transmit the virus to others, which benefits the larger community.
Additionally, a growing body of evidence suggests that people infected with HIV who consistently take antiretroviral therapy to control the virus not only protect their health but may be less infectious to others -- a theory NIAID is currently examining through clinical research.
Later this year, in collaboration with CDC and local health departments, NIAID will launch a feasibility study in several U.S. cities, designed to determine whether expanded HIV testing along with better linkages to medical care and treatment can show value as part of a broader campaign to reduce HIV incidence.
Although expanded HIV testing initiatives and prevention efforts appear to be having some positive impact, far too many people still are getting infected with HIV. Nearly three decades into the HIV/AIDS epidemic, more than 56,000 new HIV infections occur each year, an unacceptably high rate that has remained relatively stable since the late 1990s.
HIV infection may not grab the headlines as it did during the darkest days in the 1980s, but it is still a serious, incurable medical issue that can lead to AIDS -- a disease that claimed nearly 18,000 American lives in 2007. Too many people are diagnosed with HIV late in the course of infection, missing the window of opportunity when antiretroviral therapy can provide the best health outcomes.
Sadly, the stigma and fear associated with HIV testing are still very real concerns for many. On this National HIV Testing Day, we all must do our part to eliminate these obstacles and emphasize the important, lifesaving value of getting tested. To find an HIV testing site near you or for more information about HIV testing, visit AIDSinfo and AIDS.gov.

Assessed property values in Rockford Township total more than $2.3 billion and, by statute, this number represents 1/3 of the fair market value of the real property within our township... an estimated $6.9 billion.
Office staff: A professional, well-trained and dedicated team of deputy assessors, clerks, and support personnel form our team. Our staff is here to answer your questions, help find the information you need, and to assist you in all ways that we can.
Our 10 Deputy Assessors have earned the professional designation of Certified Illinois Assessment Official (CIAO) from the Illinois Property Assessment Institute.
What to expect: We are committed to producing accurate and equitable assessments and to provide the best in customer service to you, the taxpayer. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Examine the organizational and financial dynamics at play in Rockford Township's government structure.

Construct a concise argument exploring how the annexation of New Milford and Guilford Townships in 1916 and 1929, respectively, might have impacted the distribution of resources and property values within Rockford Township.
Develop a table illustrating the correlation between the assessed property values in Rockford Township ($2.3 billion) and the estimated fair market value of the real property ($6.9 billion), and discuss the implications of this ratio on local taxation policies.


### ANSWER:
Annexation altered resource distribution; assessed values represent 1/3 of fair market value.","### FEEDBACK:  Your analysis of the annexation's impact on resource distribution is a good start, but it lacks depth and supporting evidence.

To strengthen your argument, consider incorporating specific data or statistics from the text, such as the number of parcels or population figures, to illustrate the effects of annexation on resource distribution.
When discussing the implications of the 1/3 ratio on local taxation policies, think about how this might influence the township's budgeting decisions, such as property tax rates or allocation of funds for public services."

Partitioning enhances the performance, manageability, and availability of a wide variety of applications and helps reduce the total cost of ownership for storing large amounts of data. Partitioning allows tables, indexes, and index-organized tables to be subdivided into smaller pieces, enabling these database objects to be managed and accessed at a finer level of granularity. Oracle provides a rich variety of partitioning strategies and extensions to address every business requirement. Moreover, since it is entirely transparent, partitioning can be applied to almost any application without the need for potentially expensive and time consuming application changes.
This chapter contains the following topics:
Partitioning allows a table, index, or index-organized table to be subdivided into smaller pieces, where each piece of such a database object is called a partition. Each partition has its own name, and may optionally have its own storage characteristics.
From the perspective of a database administrator, a partitioned object has multiple pieces that can be managed either collectively or individually. This gives the administrator considerable flexibility in managing partitioned objects. However, from the perspective of the application, a partitioned table is identical to a non-partitioned table; no modifications are necessary when accessing a partitioned table using SQL queries and DML statements.
Figure 2-1 offers a graphical view of how partitioned tables differ from non-partitioned tables.
Note:All partitions of a partitioned object must reside in tablespaces of a single block size.
See Also:Oracle Database Concepts for more information about multiple block sizes
Each row in a partitioned table is unambiguously assigned to a single partition. The partitioning key is comprised of one or more columns that determine the partition where each row will be stored. Oracle automatically directs insert, update, and delete operations to the appropriate partition through the use of the partitioning key.
Any table can be partitioned into a million separate partitions except those tables containing columns with
RAW datatypes. You can, however, use tables containing columns with
Note:To reduce disk usage and memory usage (specifically, the buffer cache), you can store tables and partitions of a partitioned table in a compressed format inside the database. This often leads to a better scaleup for read-only operations. Table compression can also speed up query execution. There is, however, a slight cost in CPU overhead.
See Also:Oracle Database Concepts for more information about table compression
Here are some suggestions for when to partition a table:
Tables greater than 2 GB should always be considered as candidates for partitioning.
Tables containing historical data, in which new data is added into the newest partition. A typical example is a historical table where only the current month's data is updatable and the other 11 months are read only.
When the contents of a table need to be distributed across different types of storage devices.
Here are some suggestions for when to consider partitioning an index:
Avoid rebuilding the entire index when data is removed.
Perform maintenance on parts of the data without invalidating the entire index.
Reduce the impact of index skew caused by an index on a column with a monotonically increasing value.
Partitioned index-organized tables are very useful for providing improved performance, manageability, and availability for index-organized tables.
For partitioning an index-organized table:
Partition columns must be a subset of the primary key columns
Secondary indexes can be partitioned (both locally and globally)
OVERFLOW data segments are always equi-partitioned with the table partitions
See Also:Oracle Database Concepts for more information about index-organized tables
System partitioning enables application-controlled partitioning without having the database controlling the data placement. The database simply provides the ability to break down a table into partitions without knowing what the individual partitions are going to be used for. All aspects of partitioning have to be controlled by the application. For example, an insertion into a system partitioned table without the explicit specification of a partition will fail.
System partitioning provides the well-known benefits of partitioning (scalability, availability, and manageability), but the partitioning and actual data placement are controlled by the application.
See Also:Oracle Database Data Cartridge Developer's Guide for more information about system partitioning
Information Lifecycle Management (ILM) is concerned with managing data during its lifetime. Partitioning plays a key role in ILM because it enables groups of data (that is, partitions) to be distributed across different types of storage devices and managed individually.
See Also:Chapter 5, ""Using Partitioning for Information Lifecycle Management"" for more information about Information Lifecycle Management
Unstructured data (such as images and documents) which is stored in a LOB column in the database can also be partitioned. When a table is partitioned, all the columns will reside in the tablespace for that partition, with the exception of LOB columns, which can be stored in their own tablespace.
This technique is very useful when a table is comprised of large LOBs because they can be stored separately from the main data. This can be beneficial if the main data is being frequently updated but the LOB data isn't. For example, an employee record may contain a photo which is unlikely to change frequently. However, the employee personnel details (such as address, department, manager, and so on) could change. This approach also means that cheaper storage can be used for storing the LOB data and more expensive, faster storage used for the employee record.
Partitioning can provide tremendous benefit to a wide variety of applications by improving performance, manageability, and availability. It is not unusual for partitioning to improve the performance of certain queries or maintenance operations by an order of magnitude. Moreover, partitioning can greatly simplify common administration tasks.
Partitioning also enables database designers and administrators to tackle some of the toughest problems posed by cutting-edge applications. Partitioning is a key tool for building multi-terabyte systems or systems with extremely high availability requirements.
By limiting the amount of data to be examined or operated on, and by providing data distribution for parallel execution, partitioning provides a number of performance benefits. These features include:
Partition pruning is the simplest and also the most substantial means to improve performance using partitioning. Partition pruning can often improve query performance by several orders of magnitude. For example, suppose an application contains an
Orders table containing a historical record of orders, and that this table has been partitioned by week. A query requesting orders for a single week would only access a single partition of the
Orders table. If the
Orders table had 2 years of historical data, then this query would access one partition instead of 104 partitions. This query could potentially execute 100 times faster simply because of partition pruning.
Partition pruning works with all of Oracle's other performance features. Oracle will utilize partition pruning in conjunction with any indexing technique, join technique, or parallel access method.
Partitioning can also improve the performance of multi-table joins by using a technique known as partition-wise joins. Partition-wise joins can be applied when two tables are being joined together and both tables are partitioned on the join key, or when a reference partitioned table is joined with its parent table. Partition-wise joins break a large join into smaller joins that occur between each of the partitions, completing the overall join in less time. This offers significant performance benefits both for serial and parallel execution.
Partitioning allows tables and indexes to be partitioned into smaller, more manageable units, providing database administrators with the ability to pursue a ""divide and conquer"" approach to data management. With partitioning, maintenance operations can be focused on particular portions of tables. For example, a database administrator could back up a single partition of a table, rather than backing up the entire table. For maintenance operations across an entire database object, it is possible to perform these operations on a per-partition basis, thus dividing the maintenance process into more manageable chunks.
A typical usage of partitioning for manageability is to support a ""rolling window"" load process in a data warehouse. Suppose that a DBA loads new data into a table on a weekly basis. That table could be partitioned so that each partition contains one week of data. The load process is simply the addition of a new partition using a partition exchange load. Adding a single partition is much more efficient than modifying the entire table, since the DBA does not need to modify any other partitions.
Partitioned database objects provide partition independence. This characteristic of partition independence can be an important part of a high-availability strategy. For example, if one partition of a partitioned table is unavailable, then all of the other partitions of the table remain online and available. The application can continue to execute queries and transactions against the available partitions for the table, and these database operations will run successfully, provided they do not need to access the unavailable partition.
The database administrator can specify that each partition be stored in a separate tablespace; the most common scenario is having these tablespaces stored on different storage tiers. Storing different partitions in different tablespaces allows the database administrator to do backup and recovery operations on each individual partition, independent of the other partitions in the table. Thus allowing the active parts of the database to be made available sooner so access to the system can continue, while the inactive data is still being restored. Moreover, partitioning can reduce scheduled downtime. The performance gains provided by partitioning may enable database administrators to complete maintenance operations on large database objects in relatively small batch windows.
Oracle Partitioning offers three fundamental data distribution methods as basic partitioning strategies that control how data is placed into individual partitions:
Using these data distribution methods, a table can either be partitioned as a single list or as a composite partitioned table:
Each partitioning strategy has different advantages and design considerations. Thus, each strategy is more appropriate for a particular situation.
A table is defined by specifying one of the following data distribution methodologies, using one or more columns as the partitioning key:
For example, consider a table with a column of type
NUMBER as the partitioning key and two partitions
less_than_one_thousand partition contains rows where the following condition is true:
500 <= partitioning key < 1000
Figure 2-2 offers a graphical view of the basic partitioning strategies for a single-level partitioned table.
Range partitioning maps data to partitions based on ranges of values of the partitioning key that you establish for each partition. It is the most common type of partitioning and is often used with dates. For a table with a date column as the partitioning key, the
January-2005 partition would contain rows with partitioning key values from 01-Jan-2005 to 31-Jan-2005.
Each partition has a
THAN clause, which specifies a non-inclusive upper bound for the partitions. Any values of the partitioning key equal to or higher than this literal are added to the next higher partition. All partitions, except the first, have an implicit lower bound specified by the
THAN clause of the previous partition.
MAXVALUE literal can be defined for the highest partition.
MAXVALUE represents a virtual infinite value that sorts higher than any other possible value for the partitioning key, including the NULL value.
Hash partitioning maps data to partitions based on a hashing algorithm that Oracle applies to the partitioning key that you identify. The hashing algorithm evenly distributes rows among partitions, giving partitions approximately the same size.
Hash partitioning is the ideal method for distributing data evenly across devices. Hash partitioning is also an easy-to-use alternative to range partitioning, especially when the data to be partitioned is not historical or has no obvious partitioning key.
Note:You cannot change the hashing algorithms used by partitioning.
List partitioning enables you to explicitly control how rows map to partitions by specifying a list of discrete values for the partitioning key in the description for each partition. The advantage of list partitioning is that you can group and organize unordered and unrelated sets of data in a natural way. For a table with a region column as the partitioning key, the
North America partition might contain values
DEFAULT partition enables you to avoid specifying all possible values for a list-partitioned table by using a default partition, so that all rows that do not map to any other partition do not generate an error.
Composite partitioning is a combination of the basic data distribution methods; a table is partitioned by one data distribution method and then each partition is further subdivided into subpartitions using a second data distribution method. All subpartitions for a given partition together represent a logical subset of the data.
Composite partitioning supports historical operations, such as adding new range partitions, but also provides higher degrees of potential partition pruning and finer granularity of data placement through subpartitioning. Figure 2-3 offers a graphical view of range-hash and range-list composite partitioning, as an example.
Composite range-hash partitioning partitions data using the range method, and within each partition, subpartitions it using the hash method. Composite range-hash partitioning provides the improved manageability of range partitioning and the data placement, striping, and parallelism advantages of hash partitioning.
Composite range-list partitioning partitions data using the range method, and within each partition, subpartitions it using the list method. Composite range-list partitioning provides the manageability of range partitioning and the explicit control of list partitioning for the subpartitions.
In addition to the basic partitioning strategies, Oracle Database provides partitioning extensions:
These extensions significantly enhance the manageability of partitioned tables:
Interval partitioning is an extension of range partitioning which instructs the database to automatically create partitions of a specified interval when data inserted into the table exceeds all of the existing range partitions. You must specify at least one range partition. The range partitioning key value determines the high value of the range partitions, which is called the transition point, and the database creates interval partitions for data beyond that transition point. The lower boundary of every interval partition is the non-inclusive upper boundary of the previous range or interval partition.
For example, if you create an interval partitioned table with monthly intervals and the transition point at January 1, 2007, then the lower boundary for the January 2007 interval is January 1, 2007. The lower boundary for the July 2007 interval is July 1, 2007, regardless of whether the June 2007 partition was already created.
When using interval partitioning, consider the following restrictions:
You can only specify one partitioning key column, and it must be of
Interval partitioning is not supported for index-organized tables.
You cannot create a domain index on an interval-partitioned table.
You can create single-level interval partitioned tables as well as the following composite partitioned tables:
The Partition Advisor is part of the SQL Access Advisor. The Partition Advisor can recommend a partitioning strategy for a table based on a supplied workload of SQL statements which can be supplied by the SQL Cache, a SQL Tuning set, or be defined by the user.
These extensions extend the flexibility in defining partitioning keys:
Reference partitioning allows the partitioning of two tables related to one another by referential constraints. The partitioning key is resolved through an existing parent-child relationship, enforced by enabled and active primary key and foreign key constraints.
The benefit of this extension is that tables with a parent-child relationship can be logically equi-partitioned by inheriting the partitioning key from the parent table without duplicating the key columns. The logical dependency will also automatically cascade partition maintenance operations, thus making application development easier and less error-prone.
An example of reference partitioning is the
OrderItems tables related to each other by a referential constraint
Orders table is range partitioned on
OrderDate. Reference partitioning on
OrderItems leads to creation of the following partitioned table, which is equi-partitioned with respect to the
Orders table, as shown in Figure 2-4 and Figure 2-5.
All basic partitioning strategies are available for reference Partitioning. Interval partitioning cannot be used with reference partitioning.
In previous releases of the Oracle Database, a table could only be partitioned if the partitioning key physically existed in the table. In Oracle Database 11g, virtual columns remove that restriction and allow the partitioning key to be defined by an expression, using one or more existing columns of a table. The expression is stored as metadata only.
Oracle Partitioning has been enhanced to allow a partitioning strategy to be defined on virtual columns. For example, a 10 digit account ID can include account branch information as the leading 3 digits. With the extension of virtual column based Partitioning, an
ACCOUNTS table containing an
ACCOUNT_ID column can be extended with a virtual (derived) column
ACCOUNT_BRANCH that is derived from the first three digits of the
ACCOUNT_ID column, which becomes the partitioning key for this table.
Virtual column-based Partitioning is supported with all basic partitioning strategies, including interval and interval-* composite partitioning.
Just like partitioned tables, partitioned indexes improve manageability, availability, performance, and scalability. They can either be partitioned independently (global indexes) or automatically linked to a table's partitioning method (local indexes). In general, you should use global indexes for OLTP applications and local indexes for data warehousing or DSS applications. Also, whenever possible, you should try to use local indexes because they are easier to manage. When deciding what kind of partitioned index to use, you should consider the following guidelines in order:
If the table partitioning column is a subset of the index keys, use a local index. If this is the case, you are finished. If this is not the case, continue to guideline 2.
If the index is unique and does not include the partitioning key columns, then use a global index. If this is the case, then you are finished. Otherwise, continue to guideline 3.
If your priority is manageability, use a local index. If this is the case, you are finished. If this is not the case, continue to guideline 4.
If the application is an OLTP one and users need quick response times, use a global index. If the application is a DSS one and users are more interested in throughput, use a local index.
See Also:Chapter 6, ""Using Partitioning in a Data Warehouse Environment"" and Chapter 7, ""Using Partitioning in an Online Transaction Processing Environment"" for more information about partitioned indexes and how to decide which type to use
Local partitioned indexes are easier to manage than other types of partitioned indexes. They also offer greater availability and are common in DSS environments. The reason for this is equipartitioning: each partition of a local index is associated with exactly one partition of the table. This enables Oracle to automatically keep the index partitions in sync with the table partitions, and makes each table-index pair independent. Any actions that make one partition's data invalid or unavailable only affect a single partition.
Local partitioned indexes support more availability when there are partition or subpartition maintenance operations on the table. A type of index called a local nonprefixed index is very useful for historical databases. In this type of index, the partitioning is not on the left prefix of the index columns.
See Also:Chapter 4 for more information about prefixed indexes
You cannot explicitly add a partition to a local index. Instead, new partitions are added to local indexes only when you add a partition to the underlying table. Likewise, you cannot explicitly drop a partition from a local index. Instead, local index partitions are dropped only when you drop a partition from the underlying table.
A local index can be unique. However, in order for a local index to be unique, the partitioning key of the table must be part of the index's key columns.
Figure 2-6 offers a graphical view of local partitioned indexes.
Oracle offers two types of global partitioned indexes: range partitioned and hash partitioned.
Global range partitioned indexes are flexible in that the degree of partitioning and the partitioning key are independent from the table's partitioning method.
The highest partition of a global index must have a partition bound, all of whose values are
MAXVALUE. This ensures that all rows in the underlying table can be represented in the index. Global prefixed indexes can be unique or nonunique.
You cannot add a partition to a global index because the highest partition always has a partition bound of
MAXVALUE. If you wish to add a new highest partition, use the
PARTITION statement. If a global index partition is empty, you can explicitly drop it by issuing the
PARTITION statement. If a global index partition contains data, dropping the partition causes the next highest partition to be marked unusable. You cannot drop the highest partition in a global index.
Global hash partitioned indexes improve performance by spreading out contention when the index is monotonically growing. In other words, most of the index insertions occur only on the right edge of an index.
By default, the following operations on partitions on a heap-organized table mark all global indexes as unusable:
ADD (HASH) COALESCE (HASH) DROP EXCHANGE MERGE MOVE SPLIT TRUNCATE
These indexes can be maintained by appending the clause
UPDATE INDEXES to the SQL statements for the operation. The two advantages to maintaining global indexes:
The index remains available and online throughout the operation. Hence no other applications are affected by this operation.
The index doesn't have to be rebuilt after the operation.
Note:This feature is supported only for heap-organized tables.
Figure 2-7 offers a graphical view of global partitioned indexes.
Global non-partitioned indexes behave just like a non-partitioned index.
Figure 2-8 offers a graphical view of global non-partitioned indexes.
You can create bitmap indexes on partitioned tables, with the restriction that the bitmap indexes must be local to the partitioned table. They cannot be global indexes.
Global indexes can be unique. Local indexes can only be unique if the partitioning key is a part of the index key. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

Snowmass fossil site continues to be ‘treasure trove’
Day by day, an Ice Age fossil site discovered last fall near Snowmass Village is continuing to grow in stature and scientific importance as excavators retrieve bones by the boxes full.
The Denver Museum of Nature & Science resumed digging at the site this spring, and by Thursday night had racked up 864 fossils, even more than the 600 or so found last fall.
“We’re pulling out about a hundred bones a day now,” said paleontologist Kirk Johnson, who is leading the excavation for the museum.
He said the success of the excavation and its discoveries are exceeding expectations.
“It’s really a treasure trove. It’s amazing,” he said.
The first discovery of fossils occurred Oct. 14, when a contractor unearthed bones from a Columbian mammoth during expansion of a reservoir for the town of Snowmass Village. Within a month, excavators unearthed bones from another mammoth, and from mastodons, an Ice Age bison, a Jefferson’s ground sloth, an Ice Age deer and other animals.
Previously, only three mastodons had been discovered in Colorado. The Jefferson’s ground sloth discovery was a first for Colorado, and Snowmass was the only place in Colorado, and one of few places in North America, where mammoths and mastodons have been found in the same location.
This spring’s discoveries include an Ice Age camel and parts of other animals that have yet to be identified. But, Johnson said, “It’s really turning into a mastodon story this year. Boy, we’re going to have a smashing collection of mastodons in Denver.”
The museum had trademarked a name — the Snowmastodon Project — that has become particularly fitting in light of this spring’s findings. Johnson said crews this year have discovered the bottom of an ancient lake bed covered with skulls, tusks, limb bones and other mastodon fossils, from infant to adult. They’ve found a 7-inch thigh bone believed to have come from a fetal mastodon, which compares with the 4-foot thighs of adults.
With as many as 27 tusks discovered to date, that means a minimum of 14 mastodon discoveries, which compares with a record of 31 at any one site. But researchers won’t know how many individual animals they’ve discovered until they’ve had a closer look at the fossils, Johnson said.
Also being discovered at the same level are fossils of trees and an abundance of pollen that suggest the mastodons lived in a warmer, interglacial period of probably more than 100,000 years ago.
“It looks … like the animals just lived and died along the shores of this lake, and the lake was very efficient in accumulating and preserving the bones,” Johnson said.
That contrasts with a higher layer of peat where mammoths, bison and deer were found, in some cases apparently because they became stuck in the peat and couldn’t escape.
When they first resumed digging at the site, excavation crews this spring could relate to those animals’ fates. For the first 11 days, heavy snow and other precipitation resulted in about one-third of those working on-site each day finding themselves stuck in mud, Johnson said.
“It was a total quagmire,” he said.
This is the museum’s largest fossil-excavation project. By Friday, the resumption of digging was in its 21st day.
“We’ve pulled together a great team of 36 scientists from 17 universities in four countries, and they’re really deeply engaged,” Johnson said.
Also on-site are 107 trained volunteers, 35 staff members and nine interns. Another dozen or so people will join the crew this weekend, and a group of local educators also has been selected to help out this month and share their experiences with students and their communities.
Johnson said a few “expert dinosaur diggers” have been recruited to help protect the numerous big bones being discovered by encasing them in plaster.
The crews have until July 1 to finish work on what is considered the best Ice Age fossil site in Colorado and best high-elevation Ice Age site in North America. After that, the Snowmass Water & Sanitation District needs to resume enlargement of the reservoir in order to help meet the town’s water needs.
Johnson said an observer or two will remain on-site during construction work this summer to keep an eye out for any other fossils that might surface.
The reservoir will be lined with impermeable clay, and any fossils not yet uncovered will remain protected and in place, awaiting possible excavation in some future generation after the reservoir is decommissioned.
Because of the hurry to keep digging this spring, no public access is being provided to the dig site. A staffed, interpretative display can be found at the Snowmass Mall in Snowmass Village all summer, and on June 18–19, the Snowmass Ice Age Spectacular is planned, featuring unearthed bones and live broadcasts from the dig site.
Johnson said there will be a public talk June 15 at Colorado Mountain College in Glenwood Springs and two public events June 23 at the Aspen Institute.
The water district, town and museum have set a $1 million fundraising goal to help cover excavation, preservation, public outreach and other aspects of the project. With a recent $100,000 donation by the Crown family, which owns the Aspen Skiing Co., $460,000 has been raised to date.
As excited as Johnson is about the discoveries at the site to date, he said one thing noticeably lacking is any carnivore fossils. Scientists still hope to find signs of predators such as wolves, bears or saber-toothed tigers.
“There’s some cool animals that ought to be here that we haven’t seen yet,” he said. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Compare and contrast the discovery of fossils in the higher layer of peat and the lower layer of ancient lake bed at the Snowmass Ice Age fossil site.

In a paragraph, describe the type of animals found at each layer and explain how they likely ended up there.
Include in your comparison the environmental conditions inferred from the fossils and other evidence at each layer.


### ANSWER:
The discovery of fossils in the higher layer of peat and the lower layer of ancient lake bed at the Snowmass Ice Age fossil site reveals distinct differences in the types of animals found and the environmental conditions that existed at each layer. In the higher layer of peat, fossils of mammoths, bison, and deer were found, often with evidence suggesting that they became stuck in the peat and were unable to escape. In contrast, the lower layer of ancient lake bed yielded a large collection of mastodon fossils, including skulls, tusks, limb bones, and other remains, from infant to adult. The presence of tree fossils and an abundance of pollen at this layer suggests that the mastodons lived in a warmer, interglacial period, likely over 100,000 years ago. The environmental conditions at the two layers differ, with the peat layer indicating a colder, wetter climate, and the lake bed layer suggesting a more temperate climate with a lake that efficiently accumulated and preserved the bones. The differences in fossil discoveries and environmental conditions at each layer provide valuable insights into the lives and habitats of these Ice Age animals.","### FEEDBACK:  Your comparison of the discovery of fossils in the higher layer of peat and the lower layer of ancient lake bed at the Snowmass Ice Age fossil site is thorough and well-supported by the text.

To strengthen your comparison, consider explicitly stating the environmental conditions inferred from the fossils and other evidence at each layer, as mentioned in the text. For example, you could mention that the peat layer suggests a colder, wetter climate, while the lake bed layer suggests a more temperate climate with a lake that efficiently accumulated and preserved the bones.
Additionally, consider providing more specific details about the types of animals found at each layer. For example, you could mention that the peat layer yielded fossils of mammoths, bison, and deer, as well as evidence of their entrapment in the peat. In contrast, the lake bed layer yielded a large collection of mastodon fossils, including skulls, tusks, limb bones, and other remains, from infant to adult."

(All images may be enlarged by clicking on them.)
Picasso[i] had several relationships, but he was a husband to Russian ballerina Olga Kokhlova (17 June 1891 – 11 February 1955). He met Olga during the production of the Ballets Russes‘ Parade (1917). In the early years of the twentieth century, there was no better creative milieu in Paris than Sergei Diaghilev‘s (1872 –1929) Ballets Russes. The Russian impresario recruited the most talented individuals of his days and, among them, Pablo Picasso (25 October 1881 – 8 April 1973). When he was employed by Sergei Diaghilev, Picasso was mixing with le tout Paris, or the cream of Parisian society.

For instance, the production of the ballet Parade (1917) brought together composer Érik Satie (17 May 1866 – 1 July 1925), legendary writer and future filmmaker Jean Cocteau (5 July 1889 –11 October 1963) and choreographer Léonide Massine (9 August 1896 – 15 March 1979).
Érik Satie (17 May 1866 – 1 July 1925) was one of the main composers of his era. Beginning in 1888, Satie composed the Gymnopédies.[ii] Jean Cocteau is the author of the 1929 novel Les Enfants terribles, which he would transform into a film in 1950.[iii] Finally, when it premièred at Paris’ Théâtre du Châtelet, on 18 May 1917, Parade was conducted by Ernest Ansermet (11 November 1883 – 20 February 1969) who founded l’Orchestre de la Suisse Romande (1918).
Shown below is Parade‘s curtain, Picasso’s largest work. It features the nimble Harlequin, a recurring figure in Picasso’s artwork, portrayed here in the artist’s first work as costume and set designer. Parade’s curtain also features mythology’s winged horse Pegasus. Later in Picasso’s career, mythology, the Minotaur in particular, would be a significant motif.

In 1919, Ernest Ansermet would conduct Manuel de Falla‘s (23 November 1876 – 14 November 1946) El Sombrero de tres picos (The Three-Cornered Hat or Le Tricorne), a Ballets Russes production choreographed by Léonide Massine with costumes and set designed by Pablo Picasso. The Three-Cornered Hat premièred in London at the Alhambra Theatre, on 22 July 1919.
Pulcinella (Polichinelle) is a zanni from la commedia dell’arte. Igor Stravinsky composed the music. The ballet was choreographed by Léonide Massine, who also wrote the ballet’s libretto (the text), and Pablo Picasso designed the costumes and the set. Pulchinella was first performed on 15 May 1920 under the baton of Ernest Ansermet at the Paris Opera (Palais Garnier).
The Ballets Russes would also employ costume and set designers Léon Bakst and Alexandre Benois (both Russian) and choreographers Marius Petipa and Michel Fokine. However, the Ballets Russes had no greater star than Polish ballet dancer and choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky (12 March 1889/1890 [Kiev]– 8 April 1950).
Diaghilev was at times a little too punctilious, but his contribution to what composer Richard Wagner called Gesamtkunstwerk (total art) is exemplary. The Ballets Russes defined an entire era of the twentieth century and Pablo Picasso’s work with the company gave enormous impetus to his career.
Allow me to quote the UK Guardian (Luke Jennings; 10 May 2010), on the Ballets Russes:
This was more than just a dance company; it was a creative movement which, from its inception, drew to itself the greatest musical, theatrical and artistic talents of the day.
American writer Gertrude Stein lived here with her brother Leo and then with Alice B. Toklas. She received numerous artists and writers from 1903 to 1938.
Americans in Paris: Gertrude Stein
On 4 April 2013, I posted an article entitled Henri Matisse: an Eclectic Modernist. It refers to Picasso’s acquaintance with Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas, members of Stein’s family, and the Cone sisters. The next two paragraphs are therefore somewhat repetitive. Yet, it should be mentioned that Picasso’s most fervent aficionados and promoters were Americans in Paris. He owes much of his relatively early success to Leo Stein and his sister Gertrude Stein (3 February 1874 – 27 July 1946). In fact, we could start a whole new series entitled: Americans in Paris. These Americans were wealthy and became patrons to the Impressionists and all that was avant-gardiste in Paris: Fauvism, Cubism, Surrealism, etc.
Gertrude Stein was a salonnière. Few addresses are as famous as 27, rue de Fleurus, Paris 6. An invitation to 27, rue de Fleurus, Stein’s home and that of her lover, Alice B. Toklas, was almost as much a privilege in twentieth-century Paris as entrée to Madame Geoffrin‘s Parisian salon had been in the eighteenth century.
Madame Stein is the Gertrude Stein of “a rose is a rose is a rose” who entitled her 1933 autobiography The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas. As for Alice B. Toklas, Stein’s lover, she is the author of the Alice B. Toklas Cookbook of the famous hashish cookies. Born in 1877, Alice died in poverty, the victim of greed, on 7 March 1967, aged 89. (See Henri Matisse: an Eclectic Modernist.)
Olga Kokhlova was a socialite and therefore facilitated Picasso’s introduction to Paris’ world of music, design, choreography, dance, and literature. The two married on 18 May 1917 and, three years after Parade, on 4 February 1921, Olga gave birth to Picasso’s first son, Paulo, depicted above as Harlequin and Pierrot (Pedrolino), Commedia dell’arte figures.
Picasso’s marriage to Olga (17 June 1891 – on 11 February 1955) was not a happy union. It seems the two were not suited for one another. In 1927, Picasso entered into a relationship with another woman. Olga left in 1935 and, as is well known, Picasso refused to divorce her because he would have had to give her half of his belongings, including his paintings. That was not acceptable to him. (See Olga Khokhlova, Wikipedia.)
But let us return to Harlequin. In 1906, Picasso depicted him as dead (see below). At that point, reports of Harlequin’s death were premature. Picasso continued to depict Harlequin and other characters from the Commedia dell’arte, which makes him heir to Jean-Antoine Watteau (baptised 10 October 1684 – 18 July 1721).
However, Picasso’s settings of Commedia dell’arte figures are less ethereal than Watteau’s bucolic fêtes galantes. Yet both artists drew part of their subject matter from Italian comedy and from ballet, without portraying disorderly buffoons. Picasso was also influenced by seventeenth-century Spanish artists Diego Velásquez – “Las Meninas” – and El Greco.
In short, despite a failed marriage, Paris was kind to Picasso who remembered Harlequin and other characters from the Commedia dell’arte.
I apologize for not posting more often. The problem is a long and disabling episode of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
Kind regards to all of you. ♥

5 Ways AI is Already Part of Your Daily Life
When we think about AI, we tend to envision a futuristic technology which is yet to become integrated with society. The reality is actually very different. Most of us interact with AI on a daily basis, but are simply unaware of its presence.
Here are 5 ways AI is already a more significant part of your life than you think.
1 – Media Streaming Services
Almost everyone uses a streaming platform of some description. Netflix, Spotify and YouTube are all good examples. However, not so many of us are aware that your next suggested song or video is being recommended by AI. Algorithms analyse what you watch or listen to, and once enough data has been collected, will start suggesting content which matches your interests. A very similar process occurs with online shopping and recommended products.
2 – Voice Assistants
It could be Siri, Cortana, or Alexa. Voice assistants have become a common accessory, with almost every smartphone having one. But did you know these smart assistants use a form of AI known as Natural Language Processing (or NLP) to understand what you are saying? They learn from your requests and commands, creating an increasingly tailored user experience based on the information you provide.
3 – Spam Filters
Junk mail is one of those annoying facts of life, fortunately filters usually do a great job of identifying what is and isn’t spam. The filters utilise Machine Learning, where the machine (algorithm) is trained to differentiate between genuine emails and spam. This process works by highlighting keywords which are typically associated with spam, and using them to assess incoming mail. Sometimes junk mail may slip through the net, but by flagging it as spam, you are essentially teaching the algorithm to filter similar emails in the future!
4 – Fraud Detection
Almost 1/10 adults in the UK (9%) have been a victim of card fraud, and this figure is expected to rise. As a result, banks have implemented sophisticated fraud detection systems which can identify suspicious activity on your card. But how do these systems work? AI is used to gather behavioral information, such as your spending habits and location of transactions. It can then use this information to identify suspicious activity, like unusually large or frequent transactions in a short space of time, and notify your bank.
5 – Customer Support
Customer support has become increasingly AI-based over the past decade. This has mainly been achieved through the use of chatbots. Just like voice assistants, these bots use NLP to process customer queries and formulate a helpful response with the information they have access to, i.e. opening times, return policies or contact information. If a question is asked that the bot cannot answer, or does not understand, it can notify a member of the customer service team to step in and continue the conversation.
Hopefully this has demonstrated how AI is already a significant part of our daily lives. There are many other examples outside of this list, and as time passes we will see this technology take on even more responsibility in both the workplace and at home.

Design a New AI-Powered Application for Daily Life

Imagine you have the opportunity to create a new AI-powered application that could be used by people in their daily lives. Choose a problem or task that you think AI could help solve, and describe how your application would use AI to address this problem. Be sure to include what type of AI technology your application would use (e.g. Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, etc.) and how it would improve people's daily lives.


### ANSWER:
I propose an AI-powered application called 'DreamPal' that helps people improve their sleep quality by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. DreamPal would be a voice assistant that utilizes NLP to monitor and analyze users' sleep patterns, including sleep duration, quality, and stages (e.g., REM, non-REM). The application would also use Machine Learning to identify factors that affect users' sleep, such as caffeine consumption, physical activity, and screen time. Based on this data, DreamPal would provide users with personalized recommendations to enhance their sleep quality, such as suggesting relaxing exercises, setting a consistent sleep schedule, or limiting caffeine intake before bedtime.","### FEEDBACK:  Your proposal for DreamPal is a great start, but there are a few areas that need improvement.

To make your proposal more comprehensive, consider adding a section on how DreamPal would address potential biases in its sleep quality analysis. For example, you could discuss how the application would account for differences in sleep patterns between men and women, or how it would handle cases where users have underlying medical conditions that affect their sleep.
To make your proposal more actionable, consider adding a section on how you would test and validate DreamPal's effectiveness. For example, you could discuss how you would conduct user studies to evaluate the application's impact on sleep quality, or how you would use data from existing sleep tracking devices to validate the accuracy of DreamPal's analysis."

BUKU INI DI TULIS PADA TAHUN 1869 OLEH SEORANG MUBALIGH AMERIKA YANG MERANCANG DAKWAH KRISTIAN DI MALAYSIA
“THE MALAYSIA MISSION OF THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH”
By : The Rev. JOHN RUSSELL DENYES
MISSIONARY, SINGAPORE MALAYSIA, 1869
Saya memetik tulisan yang di buat pengarang bagi makluman semua tentang bagaimana kristian berdakawah di Malaysia. Buku ini telah di tulis 140 tahun dahulu dan sangat menarik untuk tatapan kita semua.
Malaysia merangkumi Indonesia, Semenanjung, Borneo dan Filipina
Dalam tulisannya Rev John Russell menyifatkan seluruh kepualaun Melayu ini sebagai Malaysia. Ini membawa erti bahawa semua kepualaun ini adalah merupakan satu negara sebelum dipecah-pecahkan oleh barat.
“Malaysia, the home of the Malay, or brown man, to the southeast of Asia, between Indo-China and Austraha. It includes the Malay Peninsula and the larger half of the islands of the Eastern Archipelago. The Land group are Sumatra, a country as large as the States of Areas Iowa, Missouri, and Arkansas; Java, of the size of New York State; Celebes, the territorial equal of all New England; Borneo, nearly four times as large as Illinois; and all the hundreds of lesser islands and islets which appear so insignificant upon the map, but which are in reality countries capable of supporting a large population. The Philippine Islands are properly a part of Malaysia, but as they are treated in a separate booklet they will not be discussed further in this one.
The land area embraced within the bounds of Malaysia amounts to seven hundred thousand square miles, a territory equal to one fifth of the area of the United States. Much of the country is mountainous. In Sumatra and Java and in many of the smaller islands there are active volcanoes, and these countries are subject to frequent and violent earthquakes. The climate is hot and moist. The Climate thermometer stands at about ninety degrees in the shade the year around.”
Agama orang Melayu ketika itu
“Speaking generally, the Malays are Mohammedans. Before the introduction of Mohammedanism, Brahmanism, Sivaism, and Buddliism prevailed largely throughout Sumatra and Java. This is shown by the numerous ruins of old temples, scattered all over these Mohammedans islands. Even now Islam does not mean here what it does in Arabia and Turkey. The Malay has adopted the creed of Mohammed, but this has “only increased the number of supersensual beings to whom he prays.”
Bila Dakwah Kristian Bermula ?
“Mission work has been carried on among the people of the Dutch possessions in Malaysia since 1603. The results have not been very gratifying, owing partly to the methods adopted and partly to the opposition of the government to the use of aggressive measures in evangelization. Dr. Callenbach, a Dutch authority, says that in 1900 there were ” some 41 European clergymen and evangelists, aided by 355 ordained natives, native preachers and teachers, working among 234,073 natives of the undenominational Protestant Church of the East Indies.”
Penumpuan Kristian Kepada Pelajar2 Sekolah
“The people are content with their own way of living, and resent any interference on the part of a foreigner. But let a boy or a girl become a pupil in one of the mission schools,and the whole situation is at once altered. Interest in a child gives free access to the home and frequently to the hearts of the parents.
The objects of these schools are to educate the children of native Christians, to open the homes of the people to the missionaries, to remove the prejudices of the people against Christianity, and to open the eyes of the younger.
Their aims generation to the moral and spiritual possibilities to be found nowhere but in the Gospel. To this end chapel services are held daily. The children are taught to sing Christian songs, and are instructed in the fundamental truths of religion. Vohintarv Bible classes are conducted, at which a good percentage of the students are in attendance. Lessons are explained from the Christian viewpoint,and five days every week the pupils are under the influence of earnest Christian teachers.”
Hasil Dakwah kepada pelajar
“At the close of 1903 there were in Malaysia, apart from the Philippines, 26 schools, with 112 teachers and an enrollment of 3,270 pupils. The Sunday schools numbered 4G, with 102 teachers and 1,757 scholars.There were 12 foreign missionaries, 8 assistant missionaries,8 representatives of the Woman’s Foreign Missionary Society,57 local preachers, and 1,467 church members and probationers.
The Epworth League has begun its work among the youth, showing its worth here as in other mission fields. But these figures do not tell the whole story of missionary effort. Thousands of Bibles, tracts. Scripture-text pictures, and religious periodicals have been placed in non-Christian homes. Several thousand young men and young women have come under the influence of our mission schools,and while they are not as yet Christians, they have lost faith in idolatry.
A Christian sentiment has begun to pervade public thought, and on every hand are indications that the field is white already to the harvest.”
Cara Mubaligh berdakwah di kampung2
“The opening of a new station in a village or a neighborhood is Reaching usually preceded by street preaching. A missionary,the Natives with a native helper or two, finds his way into av illage, selects a convenient street corner, and begins to sing. The unusual noise attracts a crowd. The missionary mounts a doorstep or box, and explains the nature of his message and calls upon his helpers to testify to the poAver of the Gospel. Portions of the Bible,tracts, and Christian calendars are offered for sale.
Sometimes these visits are made at night, and magic lantern pictures are thrown upon a screen while the missionary tells the stories of the Bible. Sooner or later some man will be found who is ready to offer the use of a room in his home for a small rental or free for the services. As soon as the prejudice has disappeared sufficiently for the people to sit quietly and listen the crowd is divided into smaller groups, w^here more direct and personal work can be done. This is the beginning of the Sunday school. As converts begin to come in, a rudimentary church organization”
Penumpuan kepada China dan India
Kekuatan orang2 Melayu memegang islam menyebabkan mereka menumpu kepada Cina dan India.
“Up to the present time the difficulty of reaching the bigoted and fanatical Mohammedan Malays has led to the concentration of efforts upon the Chinese and the Tamils, as they represent the way of least resistance. There is good reason to believe, however, that aggressive work among the more primitive peoples of the jungles would soon yield a large harvest.”
“The first difficulty to be met in solving the problem is that of language. Malaysia is the meeting place of all languages and dialects. More than fifty languages, to say nothing of the minor dialects, are spoken on the streets of Singapore. The presiding elder of the Singapore District Speech holds Quarterly Conferences in seven distinct languages. When the various native workers are gathered together in Di.strict or Annual Conference the question of secretaries and interpreters becomes a serious one.
The language of commerce is Malay, but although the people of every land soon pick up enough of this language to transact ordinary business, very few of them ever learn enough of it to receive rehgious instruction in it. There is no other way but to seek each group in its ownl tongue. This means that every missionary who survives long enough must learn from one to five languages.”
Pergerakan Kristian di Pulau Pinang
“The records of the same 5′ear begin the stor}’ of another mission that has proved more successful. At the Annual Meeting it was decided to open work in Penang, on the westcoast of the peninsula. Penang is the second city in the Straits Settlements, and has a population of about one hundred and twenty-five thousand people, most of them being Chinese or Tamils.
“The island of Penang was acquired by the English government by cession from a native prince in 1785 for the small annual payment of $6,000. It is two miles from the mainland, and is twelve miles long and nine wide. Later a small strip was taken possession of on the opposite coast to arrest the Malay piracy of that part of the high seas. This strip is known as Province Wellesley, and was purchased for an annuity of $2,000.” \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

Explore Through Movement and Play
Encourage curiosity, discovery, and a healthy body.
Sink or Float
On and Off
Move Arms and Legs
Help with Experiments
Let Them Move Around
Why This Matters
Infants and toddlers are like scientists—curious and excited to learn about their surroundings. Children explore and learn about the world through movement and play. There are many kinds of play: exploring objects and their features using the senses, silly games with loved ones, imaginative and pretend play, creative activities such as drawing, and physical play, such as crawling or rolling a ball. Movement and play keep children healthy and build their coordination and strength.
Your child benefits from spending some playing with others, and some time playing alone, figuring things out independently (with you nearby). Help them build on their interests and see where their curiosity takes them. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Analyze the concept of movement and play in infants and toddlers, and discuss its impact on their cognitive, social, and physical development.

Explain how movement and play contribute to the cognitive development of infants and toddlers, using examples from the text to support your argument.
Discuss the role of caregiver involvement in promoting healthy movement and play habits in young children, and provide suggestions for caregivers to encourage independent play while still maintaining a supportive presence.
Compare and contrast the different types of play mentioned in the text, and argue for the importance of providing opportunities for children to engage in a variety of play experiences.


### ANSWER:
Movement and play are crucial components of infants and toddlers cognitive, social, and physical development.","### FEEDBACK:  Your analysis of the concept of movement and play in infants and toddlers is a good start, but there are a few areas that need improvement.

To strengthen your argument, consider providing more specific examples from the text to support your claims about the cognitive development of infants and toddlers. For instance, you could discuss how movement and play help children develop problem-solving skills, hand-eye coordination, and spatial awareness.
When discussing the role of caregiver involvement, try to provide more nuanced suggestions for caregivers. Instead of simply stating that caregivers should be present but not intrusive, consider offering specific strategies for balancing support with independence. For example, you could suggest that caregivers engage in activities alongside their child, but also give them space to explore and learn on their own.
To improve your comparison of different types of play, try to provide more detailed explanations of each type. For instance, you could discuss how imaginative play helps children develop social skills, such as cooperation and communication, and how creative activities like drawing promote self-expression and confidence. By providing more specific examples and explanations, you can help to clarify the importance of each type of play and argue more effectively for their value."

Make Compound Interest Work for You with the TI-84 Plus
Hopefully, you have the hang of entering values into the TVM Solver on your TI-84 Plus calculator. It might be a good idea to get a little more practice. In this exercise, you get to see what happens when compound interest is working for you rather than against you.
In this example, use the TVM Solver to answer this question:
You make a new year’s resolution to give up your daily trip to the coffee shop where you spend about $5 a day. Instead, you decide to save the money in a cookie jar and make an end-of-the-year investment of $1,825 in a growth stock mutual fund. If the mutual fund gets a 10% return a year (consider it compounded yearly), how long will it take for you to become a millionaire?
Step 1. Access the TVM Solver
Follow this step to access the TVM Solver: Press [APPS][ENTER][ENTER] to access the TVM Solver.
Step 2. Enter values for five of the six TVM variables
Here are the steps to enter values for five of the variables.
How long will it take to become a millionaire? That is the question you are trying to answer. You aren't allowed to leave a field blank, so just leave the default value of 0.
10% is entered as 10.
The present value in this problem is 0.
Remember, a cash outflow is considered a negative value. Enter the amount you are investing each year as a negative number, –1825. Alternatively, you could enter the expression –(5*365) and your calculator will evaluate the expression when you use the down-arrow key or press [ENTER] to advance to the next field.
The future value is your financial goal, $1,000,000. Notice, this number is entered as a positive number because it is a cash inflow. Of course, don’t use commas or the $ sign when entering the number.
Enter P/Y and C/Y.
Enter 1 for the number of payments per year.
Highlight PMT: END or BEGIN.
Payment is made at the end of the year in this problem. Use the left- and right-arrow keys to move your cursor to END, and press [ENTER] to highlight. See the first screen.
Step 3. Solve for the missing TVM variable
Look back at what the question is asking: How long will it take to become a millionaire?
You use the up- and down-arrow keys to place your cursor on the value you would like to solve for and press [ALPHA][ENTER]. So, move the cursor to the N value and press [ALPHA][ENTER]. See the second screen. Notice the small box next to the N value, indicating that you solved for that variable.
Were you surprised at the result? In a little over 42 years, you could be a millionaire! \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Calculate a colleague's potential retirement savings using a growth stock mutual fund and the TI-84 Plus TVM Solver.

Assume your colleague invests a fixed yearly amount of $2,500 and expects a 7% annual return compounded yearly, with the payment made at the end of the year and one payment per year.
Enter values for the TVM variables and use the solver to calculate the savings after 35 years. Use the TVM Solver to find out how much your colleague would need to invest each year to reach a financial goal of $750,000 after 30 years with the same annual return and compounding frequency.


### ANSWER:
{'N': 35, 'I%': 7, 'PV': 0, 'PMT': -2500, 'FV': 0, 'P/Y': 1, 'C/Y': 1, 'END/ BEGIN': END}","### FEEDBACK:  
Your solution is mostly correct, but there are a couple of areas that need improvement.

You correctly identified the variables and their values, but you didn't actually solve the problem. To solve the problem, you need to use the TVM Solver to calculate the savings after 35 years and the amount needed to invest each year to reach a financial goal of $750,000 after 30 years.
You didn't actually calculate the savings after 35 years. To do this, you need to press [ENTER] to advance to the next field and then press [ENTER] again to calculate the value of N. You should also calculate the amount needed to invest each year to reach a financial goal of $750,000 after 30 years."
"### ASSIGNMENT APPENDIX
Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, often abbreviated ACDF, is a commonly performed procedure for treatment of cervical spine (neck) disorders. An ACDF is usually performed to treat a degenerated or herniated disc in the neck. Disc degeneration and herniation are two common disc-related problems that may compress spinal nerve roots or the spinal cord that resides within the spinal canal.
Compression or pinching of these neurologic structures may result in neck, shoulder, upper back, and arm pain. Other neurologic symptoms may include numbness, tingling and weakness in the arms or hands. The goal of an ACDF is to decompress the nerve root(s) and spinal cord, stabilize the neck, relieve symptoms, and enable the patient to return to regular activities of daily living.
Anterior = front
The surgical incision is made in the front of the neck either on the left or right side. The incision can often be performed within a natural skin crease or skin fold helping to conceal the surgical incision when healed and provide a pleasing cosmetic result.
Cervical = neck
The cervical levels are one region of the spine. There are seven vertebral bodies in the neck; numbered C1 (top) through C7 (bottom). The disc levels are also abbreviated. For example, C3-C4 refers to the intervertebral disc between the third and fourth cervical vertebral bodies (bones).
Discectomy = to remove the disc
Through the incision, the surgeon moves soft tissues aside to reveal the disc. Using special instruments, the surgeon removes the ruptured disc from between the upper and lower vertebral bodies.
Fusion = to join or combine
Bone graft is inserted into the empty space between the upper and lower vertebral bodies. Instrumentation (cervical plate and screws) is implanted to immobilize (stabilize) the neck. The body’s natural healing processes cause new bone to grow into and around the instrumentation resulting in a spinal fusion.
Not every patient with a cervical degenerative disc problem or disc herniation requires spine surgery. Dr. Stieber may recommend an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion for the following reasons: if non-operative treatment fails to relieve symptoms, progressive worsening of neurologic symptoms or pain, spinal instability, and/or neurological problems. Numbness, loss of function, and weakness are examples of neurologic dysfunction.
About Cervical Discectomy
ACDF is performed under general anesthesia. The neck is cleansed and prepared for surgery. An incision is made on the left or right side of the neck. Muscles and other tissues are gently pulled aside to expose the disc. Dr. Stieber uses fluoroscopy, a type of real time x-ray during surgery. A thin needle is inserted into the disc, which can be viewed on fluoroscopy. Specialized surgical instruments are used to remove the ruptured disc. A spreader instrument gently separates the vertebral bodies while the disc and smaller disc pieces are removed. Disc material and bone spurs (osteophytes) that compress (pinch) spinal nerve roots are carefully removed. Bone graft fills the empty space after discectomy.
Types of Bone Graft
● Autograft is the patient’s own bone; usually taken from the hip.
● Allograft is donor bone from a bone bank.
● Bone graft substitute; there are different types, some of which are synthetic (man-made) and available in different shapes.
Screws affix a metal plate over the bone graft. The plate holds the graft in place and stabilizes the neck. Although fluoroscopy is used during ACDF, a post-operative x-ray is taken to ensure the bone graft and instrumentation is well-positioned.
After surgery, the patient is moved into the recovery area. In recovery, nurses and other members of the medical team closely monitor the patient’s vital signs – pulse, respiration, blood pressure, and pain. Some post-operative pain should be expected and patients receive pain medication either through their IV (intravenous line) or by mouth.
● A post-operative cervical brace may be prescribed to wear for a period after surgery to help immobilize and support the neck while healing.
● Many patients go home the same day as surgery. Dr. Stieber discusses the likelihood of hospitalization with patients before their surgery date.

After Care at Home
Dr. Stieber provides ACDF patients with information about what to expect and self-care after hospital discharge. This information includes instructions to control pain, medications, diet and managing constipation, bathing and incision care, activity restrictions, and the surgical follow-up appointments. As always, Dr. Stieber and his staff welcome questions and ensure that all patient concerns are thoroughly addressed. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

### ANSWER:
Dear Mom,
During my surgery, Dr. Stieber will be performing an Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF). This is a big phrase, but it can be broken down into smaller parts. 'Anterior' refers to the front of my neck, which is where Dr. Stieber will make the incision. 'Cervical' refers to my neck, which is the region of my spine that will be operated on. 'Discectomy' means that Dr. Stieber will be removing the ruptured disc from between my vertebrae. Finally, 'Fusion' means that he will be joining together my vertebrae using a bone graft and a metal plate to stabilize my neck.
To remove the ruptured disc, Dr. Stieber will make an incision in the front of my neck and gently move aside the soft tissues to reveal the disc. He will then use specialized instruments to remove the disc and any bone spurs that may be compressing my spinal nerve roots. After the disc is removed, he will insert a bone graft into the empty space to help my vertebrae fuse together. A metal plate will be attached to my vertebrae using screws to hold the bone graft in place and stabilize my neck.
After I'm discharged from the hospital, I'll need to take it easy and avoid heavy lifting, bending, or strenuous activities. I'll need to take pain medication as directed by Dr. Stieber to manage my pain, and I'll need to follow a bowel regimen to prevent constipation. I'll also need to wear a cervical brace to help immobilize and support my neck while it heals. I'll need to follow up with Dr. Stieber for post-operative appointments to ensure that my neck is healing properly.
","### FEEDBACK:  Your letter provides a good overview of the ACDF procedure and what to expect during recovery. However, there are a few areas that need improvement.

To make your letter more concise, consider breaking up the long sentence about the ACDF procedure into two separate sentences. This will make it easier for your mom to understand the different parts of the procedure.
When explaining the bowel regimen, try to be more specific about what to expect. For example, you could mention that you'll need to take a specific type of medication to prevent constipation, or that you'll need to follow a specific diet to help move food through your digestive system. This will help your mom understand what to expect and how to support you during recovery."

August is National Peach Month and we thought it would be fun to discover some interesting facts about peaches.
- The peach originated in China and has been cultivated at least since 1000 B.C.E. It has special significance in Chinese culture: the peach has mystical attributes, and supposedly brings luck, abundance and protection.
- The peach tree is considered to be the tree of life and peaches are symbols of immortality and unity. Peach blossoms are carried by Chinese brides.
- The Romans called the peaches “Persian Apples” naming them after the country that introduced peaches to the West.
- Spaniards brought peaches to South America and the French introduced them to Louisiana. The English took them to their Jamestown and Massachusetts colonies. Columbus brought peach trees to America on his second and third voyages.
- China is the largest world producer of peaches, with Italy second.
- California produces more than 50% of the peaches in the United States (and grows 175 different varieties).
- So many peaches are grown in Georgia that it became known as the Peach State.
- True wild peaches are only found in China. Unlike the cultivated fruit, the wild fruit is small, sour and very fuzzy.
- Peaches are available for u-picking at many Arizona farms including Schnepf Farms, Apple Annie’s Orchards, Sphinx Date Ranch and more. The peach season in Arizona varies with the location of the farm, so check their website for picking season. To find a local u-pick farm go to fillyourplate.org.
Nutrition and Facts
- Peaches are a good source of vitamins A, B and C. A medium peach contains only 37 calories.
- You can ripen peaches by placing them in a brown paper bag for two to three days. Sliced, fresh peaches should be tossed in lemon or lime juice to prevent browning.
- Nectarines are a variety of peach with a smooth skin, not a cross between a peach and a plum.
- The juice from peaches makes a wonderful moisturizer, and it can be found in many brands of cosmetics.
- A peach pit contains hydrocyanic acid, which is a poisonous substance.
- Like the plum and the apricot, the peach is a member of the rose family (Rosaceae), distinguished by its velvety skin. It is classified as a drupe, a fruit with a hard stone.
- The term, “you’re a real peach” originated from the tradition of giving a peach to the friend you liked.
- Most peaches are cultivated by grafting different combinations of rootstocks to scions.
- There are over 700 varieties of peaches-some Chinese varieties are even flat like hockey pucks!
- Peaches are the third most popular fruit grown in America.
- The United States provides about one-fourth (25%) of the world’s total supply of fresh peaches
- The World’s Largest Peach is located in Gaffney, South Carolina, and weighs over 10,000 pounds. The city of Gaffney, near Greenville, built this water tower in the shape of a peach back in 1981.
- Many stories have been written about Peaches including James and the Giant Peach, which was eventually made into a movie of the same name, and Momotaro, the Peach Boy; a Japanese Fairy Tale \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:

Analyzing Heart Development in Human Embryos

Based on the provided information, describe the process of formation of the septum intermedium in the atrial canal of a human embryo, specifically explaining how it divides the canal into two channels and what structures these channels will eventually become.


### ANSWER:
The septum intermedium is formed when the endocardial cushions project into the atrial canal and unite in the middle line. This division results in the creation of two channels: the future right and left atrioventricular orifices. Eventually, these channels will develop into the right and left atrioventricular openings, where the right one will become the tricuspid valve and mitral valve and the left channel will become the mitral valve and the pulmonary valve but is incorrect about it being just those two as it also refers to other incorrect information regarding comparisons of the other valve and one being incorrect.","### FEEDBACK:  The explanation of the septum intermedium's formation and its division into channels is mostly correct, but there are some inaccuracies in the description of the structures these channels will eventually become.

The statement about the left channel becoming the mitral valve and the pulmonary valve is incorrect. The correct information is that the left channel will become the mitral valve and the left pulmonary valve, not the pulmonary valve.
The comparison of the tricuspid valve and mitral valve with the pulmonary valve is also incorrect. The correct information is that the tricuspid valve and mitral valve are part of the right atrioventricular orifice, and the pulmonary valve is part of the left atrioventricular orifice."

If you’ve spent any time in the baking aisle picking out chocolate for your next baking endeavor, chances are you encountered a confusing variety of chocolate-related terms. What’s the difference between cocoa and cacao, or bittersweet and semisweet chocolate? Here is a brief guide to some of the most commonly misunderstood chocolate terms.
Cocoa Bean Terms
First, there are a few key cocoa bean terms you need to understand.
Cocoa or cacao bean
The cocoa, or cacao, bean, is the source from which chocolate is derived. These beans are found inside the fruit of the cacao tree in fleshy, oval-shaped pods and are then harvested, fermented, and dried. The important thing to keep in mind here is that the terms “cocoa bean” and “cacao bean” refer to the same bean. The terms “cocoa” and “cacao” alone, however, do carry some important differences. More on that later.
Cocoa beans that have been fermented, dried, roasted, and separated from their skins are called cocoa nibs. Cocoa nibs are then ground into a thick paste, which is called chocolate liquor. Chocolate liquor contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in roughly equal proportion.
Cocoa butter is the fatty component of the cocoa bean. It makes up 50 to 60 percent of the cocoa bean. Despite what its name might suggest, cocoa butter is dairy-free.
Cocoa solids are the non-fat part of the cocoa bean. They make up 40 to 50 percent of the cocoa bean. They are typically ground up in order to create cocoa powder.
Cocoa vs. Cacao
According to U.S. regulations, the term “cocoa” is actually used interchangeably with “cocoa powder.” (Quick refresher: cocoa powder is made by grinding up cocoa solids, the non-fat part of the cocoa bean.) In addition, the term “cocoa” may be used to designate products that are derived from roasted cocoa/cacao beans.
The term “cacao” is typically used to refer to any products that are derived from raw, unroasted cocoa beans, such as cacao nibs, cacao butter, cacao powder, and cacao paste. Unroasted beans contain more antioxidants and other essential nutrients than their roasted counterparts. That’s why you see the word “cacao” all over health food stores. (According to this article, apparently some people use cacao powder as a stimulant drug. Yikes.)
Dark vs. Vegan Chocolate
There is no official definition for dark chocolate, but it is essentially a combination of cocoa, fat, and sugar. Traditionally, no milk solids are added, differentiating it from milk chocolate, but many varieties of dark chocolate do contain some milk solid additives. Dark chocolate is often distinguished by the percentage of cocoa solids in the bar, ranging from about 30 percent (sweet dark) to 80 percent (extremely dark).
I’m including this here because a lot of people assume that all dark chocolate is vegan. Many dark chocolates, however, contain a variety of additives—such as milk, milk solids, or milk fat—which make pure chocolate no longer vegan. A vegan chocolate will typically contain only a short list of ingredients, such as cocoa, cocoa butter, lecithin, sugar, and vanilla. If you’re looking for a vegan chocolate, look for something that is dairy-free, whey-free, and casein-free.
Bittersweet vs. Semisweet Chocolate
Bittersweet chocolate is chocolate liquor with some sugar and more cocoa butter added. It usually also contains vanilla flavoring and may contain lecithin as well. Bittersweet chocolate typically has less sugar and more chocolate liquor than semisweet chocolate. When baking, however, bittersweet and semisweet chocolate are essentially interchangeable. Often, you will find the percentage of cocoa contained in bittersweet chocolate printed on the package; the higher the percentage, the less sweet the chocolate.
Semisweet chocolate is chocolate liquor with some sugar and cocoa butter added. It usually contains more sugar than bittersweet chocolate, but since the terms “bittersweet” and “semisweet” are not regulated, this is not always the case.
Natural vs. Dutch Process Cocoa
Natural cocoa powder is ground up cocoa solids. It contains naturally occurring acids, which is important to keep in mind when choosing a leavening ingredient in a baking recipe. Baking soda, for example, reacts with acid to make things rise, while baking powder contains acidic cream of tartar to make things rise.
Dutch process cocoa
Dutch process, or European style, cocoa has been treated to neutralize the naturally occurring acids. This lends Dutch process cocoa a mellower flavor and redder color.
Other Chocolate Terms
Unsweetened chocolate, or baking chocolate, is essentially chocolate liquor mixed with some form of fat to create a solid substance. It has a deep, rich chocolate flavor and is often combined with sugar to serve as a base in brownies, cakes, and cookies.
Sweet baking chocolate
Sweet chocolate is at least 15 percent pure chocolate and contains added sugar and cocoa butter. It is sweeter than semisweet chocolate.
Milk chocolate is at least 10 percent pure chocolate, with added sugar, cocoa butter, and milk solids. It has a milder flavor than darker chocolates because it contains less pure chocolate. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Develop a hypothetical recipe for a vegan, sugar-reduced, high-cocoa-content dark chocolate cake that uses Dutch process cocoa powder and explains the reasoning behind each ingredient choice.

Research and select the primary ingredients, such as cocoa content percentage and the type of sugar to use.
Calculate and justify the exact amount of sugar required for the recipe, taking into consideration the cocoa content of the dark chocolate used.
Explain why Dutch process cocoa powder was chosen for this specific recipe, considering the chemical composition of the cake.
Choose and explain any potential substitutes or leavening agents to ensure that the cake reacts correctly with the Dutch process cocoa powder, taking into account the pH level of the ingredients used.


### ANSWER:
Imagine you are a talented pastry chef and have developed a recipe for a sugar-reduced, high-cocoa-content dark chocolate cake using Dutch process cocoa powder that serves 8 people. The recipe is as follows: ingredients include 1 1/2 sticks of Earth Balance vegan butter, softened, 1 cup of coconut sugar, 1/2 cup of date syrup, 4 large egg replacers, 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, 1 1/4 cups of almond flour, 1 cup of Dutch process cocoa powder, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, and 1 cup of non-dairy buttermilk. To prepare the cake, preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease two 8-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Using an electric mixer, cream together the vegan butter and coconut sugar until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes. Beat in the date syrup, egg replacers, and vanilla extract. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the almond flour, cocoa powder, and salt. In a small bowl, whisk together the baking soda and non-dairy buttermilk. Add to the cake mixture and mix until just combined. Split the batter evenly between the prepared pans and smooth out the tops. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool in pans for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely. To assemble the cake, melt 1 cup of high-cocoa-content dark chocolate chips with 1 tablespoon of non-dairy butter in a double boiler. Place one cake layer on a serving plate, spread a thin layer of the melted chocolate on top, and place the second cake layer on top. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining melted chocolate. Serve immediately.","### FEEDBACK:  Your recipe for a sugar-reduced, high-cocoa-content dark chocolate cake using Dutch process cocoa powder is creative and well-structured. However, there are a few areas that need improvement.

To ensure the cake reacts correctly with the Dutch process cocoa powder, you should consider the pH level of the ingredients used. Dutch process cocoa powder is alkalized, which means it has a higher pH level than natural cocoa powder. To balance this, you could add a small amount of lemon juice or vinegar to the recipe to adjust the pH level. Additionally, you may want to consider using a pH test strip to ensure the batter has a pH level that is suitable for the Dutch process cocoa powder.
To make the recipe more accurate, you should specify the type of sugar to use. While coconut sugar and date syrup are both natural sweeteners, they have different properties and uses. Coconut sugar has a lower glycemic index than refined sugar, but it also has a stronger flavor. Date syrup, on the other hand, has a rich, caramel-like flavor. To make the recipe more versatile, you could specify that the sugar should be a natural sweetener with a low glycemic index, such as coconut sugar or honey."

Wyoming — History and Culture
Few other states in America embody the attitude and atmosphere of the working cowboy as much as Wyoming. This rugged, remote territory got its start with cattle ranching, but eventually added leisure tourism to its economy when the world’s first national park was established at Yellowstone. Wyoming is a four-season travel destination, with great skiing at Jackson Hole and plenty of summer outdoor adventure in the Tetons and Wind River Range. The folks here have found a way to merge their cowboy traditions with the tourist dollar by transforming dozens of huge ranches into guest ranches where visitors can live out their dreams of being a cowboy (or cowgirl) for a few days.
Several major Native American tribes lived in Wyoming prior to the arrival of the first Europeans. The Lakota, Shoshone, Crow, and Arapaho were the largest tribes living here and today, the Lakota and Shoshone share a huge Indian reservation in the Wind River Valley. They hold many sites in Wyoming as sacred, including Devils Tower and the Grand Tetons.
Though French fur trappers were the first Europeans into the area, the Lewis and Clark Expedition led by John Colter and his Shoshone wife Sacagawea reached Wyoming in 1807. Their initial reports of Yellowstone were considered to be fictional, but the discovery of South Pass in 1812 allowed the Oregon Trail to continue over the mountains into the Pacific Northwest. In 1850 Jim Bridger discovered Bridger Pass, which was later used by the Union Pacific Railroad in 1868 and again by Interstate 80 to help travelers get through the dense Rocky Mountains.
When the Union Pacific Railroad reached the city of Cheyenne in 1867, Wyoming really began to open up to immigration and trade. The Wyoming Territory was established by the US government that same year. After endless speculation over the reality of Yellowstone’s natural wonders, enough people finally witnessed the place to encourage the US government to create the world’s first national park in 1872.
Wyoming has been a progressive state from the start. In 1869, its governor granted women the right to vote in local elections, making Wyoming the first US state to allow women’s suffrage. The state boasts the country’s first female governor (in 1924), an event which earned it the nickname the Equality State.
The early economy was based largely around cattle ranching, and the state still has a sizeable dude ranch sector. This has evolved into tourism revenue with the creation of guest ranches that allow visitors to experience cowboy life without any of the hardships. Yellowstone National Park helped open up the West to the concept of leisure travel, with tourism further expanded in the state when the Grand Tetons were developed into the ski area of Jackson Hole and Grand Tetons National Park. Tourism remains an essential component of Wyoming’s economy.
Wyoming’s nickname, the Cowboy State, perfectly describes the prevailing vibe of this true grit Western territory. Genuine cattle ranches with working cowboys can be seen throughout Wyoming, and even many newcomers have eagerly adopted the cowboy wannabe look and attitude. The residents of Wyoming are strong, independent people who live off the land and greatly respect it. This isn’t a place where cosmopolitan affairs concern many folks, but the locals are very welcoming to the millions of tourists who come each year to experience the beauty and cowboy culture of their state.
Besides this ranching environment, Wyoming is a haven for hardcore outdoor enthusiasts. The town of Jackson Hole is where most of them gravitate, thanks to its extremely challenging ski terrain and world-class rock climbing and mountaineering. These young adrenalin junkies make up the other main demographic of Wyoming, adding a welcome splash of color and energy to the traditional conservatism of the cowboys. \n\n","### ASSIGNMENT:
Analyze how Wyoming's progression from a ranching-based economy to a tourism-driven economy has impacted the state's cultural identity.

Explain how the establishment of Yellowstone National Park and the development of guest ranches influenced Wyoming's shift towards tourism.
Discuss the role of ranching and cowboy culture in shaping Wyoming's cultural identity, and how this has been affected by the growing presence of outdoor enthusiasts and tourists.
Consider the tension between preserving Wyoming's traditional way of life and embracing its new role as a tourist destination. What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of this shift, and how has the state navigated these changes?
Provide specific examples from the text to support your argument, and make recommendations for how Wyoming can continue to evolve while remaining true to its cultural heritage.

CAAV member and former steering committee chair Les Grady presented a talk about climate change at the Massanutten Regional Library, downtown Harrisonburg, on Monday, April 20, 2015, entitled Help! My Planet’s in Trouble and I Don’t Know What to Do.
The Daily News-Record‘s Elaina Sauber was there along with photographer Nikki Fox. The below article was published in the Daily News-Record on Tuesday, April 21, 2015.
Climate Change Talk Hopes to Educate
by Elaina Sauber
HARRISONBURG – Les Grady thinks the first step to slowing down climate change is simply talking about it.
“Bringing up climate change in a polite society stops the conversation,” said Grady, member of the steering committee for the advocacy group Climate Action Alliance of the Valley. “We just don’t want to think about it, because we feel really helpless.”
The licensed professional engineer, who has taught environmental engineering at Purdue and Clemson universities, spoke to about 30 people Monday about addressing and alleviating the effects of climate change to commemorate Earth Day, which is Wednesday. The event was held at Massanutten Regional Library’s main branch in Harrisonburg.
Grady has also worked part time for the last two decades for CH2MHILL, the world’s largest environmental engineering consulting firm.
While 97 percent of climate scientists agree that warming trends of the last century are likely due to human activities, he said, a new study from Yale University shows that only 52 percent of Americans are concerned about climate change.
Skeptics argue that the Earth experiences natural shifts in climate, and any perceived changes aren’t being driven by the burning of fossil fuels.
Grady said the first thing to recognize when it comes to climate change is that a variety of research sources confirm its existence – not just temperature records.
“In fact, temperature records are probably the least reliable in the sense of indicators,” he added, due to natural variability and the fact that only about 1 percent of the Earth’s heat is in the atmosphere.
The oceans contain most of the planet’s heat. According to research from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, oceans’ heat content has risen almost continually since the mid-1990s.
Accepting climate change as reality also means accepting the role carbon dioxide plays in exacerbating it, Grady said.
As rising carbon dioxide levels contribute to higher temperatures, precipitation and sea levels also increase, Grady said.
“The more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the warmer it’s going to be,” he said.
Developing countries in Africa, South America and Indonesia are more vulnerable to issues stemming from climate change because they don’t have the economic resources to deal with the problems it presents, Grady said.
“Many people say this is a moral and ethical question, because their contributions to the problem are negligible – they haven’t emitted very much carbon dioxide,” Grady said.
Grady listed steps people can take to help address climate change in their own lives.
In Virginia, he said, transportation is the major source of carbon dioxide emissions, followed by electricity generation through the burning of coal. While anyone can make changes to their transportation and electricity use, Grady said the political process is crucial in persuading energy providers to follow suit.
“We as citizens need to be active,” he said. “State electric generators really have not done very much, nor are they planning to, about this problem.”
He also encouraged attendees to calculate their carbon footprint using programs found on the Environmental Protection Agency’s website.
But the main course of action Grady advocates is implementing a carbon fee and dividend.
“We allow all of us to dump the waste from burning fossil fuels into the atmosphere,” he said.
A better solution, he said, is to charge households a fee commensurate with the impact of their carbon footprint, “so that when we buy it, we’re not socializing those costs anymore; they become privatized, just like the profits are.”
